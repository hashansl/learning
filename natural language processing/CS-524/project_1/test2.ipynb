abbey grange\\n the adventure of the second stain\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe adventure of the empty house\\n\\n\\n      it was in the spring of the year  that all london was\\n      interested and the fashionable world dismayed by the murder of\\n      the honourable ronald adair under most unusual and inexplicable\\n      circumstances the public has already learned those particulars\\n      of the crime which came out in the police investigation but a\\n      good deal was suppressed upon that occasion since the case for\\n      the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong that it was not\\n      necessary to bring forward all the facts only now at the end of\\n      nearly ten years am i allowed to supply those missing links\\n      which make up the whole of that remarkable chain the crime was\\n      of interest in itself but that interest was as nothing to me\\n      compared to the inconceivable sequel which afforded me the\\n      greatest shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life\\n      even now after this long interval i find myself thrilling as i\\n      think of it and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy\\n      amazement and incredulity which utterly submerged my mind let\\n      me say to that public which has shown some interest in those\\n      glimpses which i have occasionally given them of the thoughts and\\n      actions of a very remarkable man that they are not to blame me\\n      if i have not shared my knowledge with them for i should have\\n      considered it my first duty to do so had i not been barred by a\\n      positive prohibition from his own lips which was only withdrawn\\n      upon the third of last month\\n\\n      it can be imagined that my close intimacy with sherlock holmes\\n      had interested me deeply in crime and that after his\\n      disappearance i never failed to read with care the various\\n      problems which came before the public and i even attempted more\\n      than once for my own private satisfaction to employ his methods\\n      in their solution though with indifferent success there was\\n      none however which appealed to me like this tragedy of ronald\\n      adair as i read the evidence at the inquest which led up to a\\n      verdict of willful murder against some person or persons unknown\\n      i realized more clearly than i had ever done the loss which the\\n      community had sustained by the death of sherlock holmes there\\n      were points about this strange business which would i was sure\\n      have specially appealed to him and the efforts of the police\\n      would have been supplemented or more probably anticipated by\\n      the trained observation and the alert mind of the first criminal\\n      agent in europe all day as i drove upon my round i turned over\\n      the case in my mind and found no explanation which appeared to me\\n      to be adequate at the risk of telling a twicetold tale i will\\n      recapitulate the facts as they were known to the public at the\\n      conclusion of the inquest\\n\\n      the honourable ronald adair was the second son of the earl of\\n      maynooth at that time governor of one of the australian\\n      colonies adairs mother had returned from australia to undergo\\n      the operation for cataract and she her son ronald and her\\n      daughter hilda were living together at  park lane the youth\\n      moved in the best societyhad so far as was known no enemies\\n      and no particular vices he had been engaged to miss edith\\n      woodley of carstairs but the engagement had been broken off by\\n      mutual consent some months before and there was no sign that it\\n      had left any very profound feeling behind it for the rest the\\n      mans life moved in a narrow and conventional circle for his\\n      habits were quiet and his nature unemotional yet it was upon\\n      this easygoing young aristocrat that death came in most strange\\n      and unexpected form between the hours of ten and eleventwenty\\n      on the night of march  \\n\\n      ronald adair was fond of cardsplaying continually but never for\\n      such stakes as would hurt him he was a member of the baldwin\\n      the cavendish and the bagatelle card clubs it was shown that\\n      after dinner on the day of his death he had played a rubber of\\n      whist at the latter club he had also played there in the\\n      afternoon the evidence of those who had played with himmr\\n      murray sir john hardy and colonel moranshowed that the game\\n      was whist and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards\\n      adair might have lost five pounds but not more his fortune was\\n      a considerable one and such a loss could not in any way affect\\n      him he had played nearly every day at one club or other but he\\n      was a cautious player and usually rose a winner it came out in\\n      evidence that in partnership with colonel moran he had actually\\n      won as much as four hundred and twenty pounds in a sitting some\\n      weeks before from godfrey milner and lord balmoral so much for\\n      his recent history as it came out at the inquest\\n\\n      on the evening of the crime he returned from the club exactly at\\n      ten his mother and sister were out spending the evening with a\\n      relation the servant deposed that she heard him enter the front\\n      room on the second floor generally used as his sittingroom she\\n      had lit a fire there and as it smoked she had opened the window\\n      no sound was heard from the room until eleventwenty the hour of\\n      the return of lady maynooth and her daughter desiring to say\\n      goodnight she attempted to enter her sons room the door was\\n      locked on the inside and no answer could be got to their cries\\n      and knocking help was obtained and the door forced the\\n      unfortunate young man was found lying near the table his head\\n      had been horribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bullet but\\n      no weapon of any sort was to be found in the room on the table\\n      lay two banknotes for ten pounds each and seventeen pounds ten in\\n      silver and gold the money arranged in little piles of varying\\n      amount there were some figures also upon a sheet of paper with\\n      the names of some club friends opposite to them from which it\\n      was conjectured that before his death he was endeavouring to make\\n      out his losses or winnings at cards\\n\\n      a minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the\\n      case more complex in the first place no reason could be given\\n      why the young man should have fastened the door upon the inside\\n      there was the possibility that the murderer had done this and\\n      had afterwards escaped by the window the drop was at least\\n      twenty feet however and a bed of crocuses in full bloom lay\\n      beneath neither the flowers nor the earth showed any sign of\\n      having been disturbed nor were there any marks upon the narrow\\n      strip of grass which separated the house from the road\\n      apparently therefore it was the young man himself who had\\n      fastened the door but how did he come by his death no one could\\n      have climbed up to the window without leaving traces suppose a\\n      man had fired through the window he would indeed be a remarkable\\n      shot who could with a revolver inflict so deadly a wound again\\n      park lane is a frequented thoroughfare there is a cab stand\\n      within a hundred yards of the house no one had heard a shot and\\n      yet there was the dead man and there the revolver bullet which\\n      had mushroomed out as softnosed bullets will and so inflicted\\n      a wound which must have caused instantaneous death such were the\\n      circumstances of the park lane mystery which were further\\n      complicated by entire absence of motive since as i have said\\n      young adair was not known to have any enemy and no attempt had\\n      been made to remove the money or valuables in the room\\n\\n      all day i turned these facts over in my mind endeavouring to hit\\n      upon some theory which could reconcile them all and to find that\\n      line of least resistance which my poor friend had declared to be\\n      the startingpoint of every investigation i confess that i made\\n      little progress in the evening i strolled across the park and\\n      found myself about six oclock at the oxford street end of park\\n      lane a group of loafers upon the pavements all staring up at a\\n      particular window directed me to the house which i had come to\\n      see a tall thin man with coloured glasses whom i strongly\\n      suspected of being a plainclothes detective was pointing out\\n      some theory of his own while the others crowded round to listen\\n      to what he said i got as near him as i could but his\\n      observations seemed to me to be absurd so i withdrew again in\\n      some disgust as i did so i struck against an elderly deformed\\n      man who had been behind me and i knocked down several books\\n      which he was carrying i remember that as i picked them up i\\n      observed the title of one of them the origin of tree worship\\n      and it struck me that the fellow must be some poor bibliophile\\n      who either as a trade or as a hobby was a collector of obscure\\n      volumes i endeavoured to apologize for the accident but it was\\n      evident that these books which i had so unfortunately maltreated\\n      were very precious objects in the eyes of their owner with a\\n      snarl of contempt he turned upon his heel and i saw his curved\\n      back and white sidewhiskers disappear among the throng\\n\\n      my observations of no  park lane did little to clear up the\\n      problem in which i was interested the house was separated from\\n      the street by a low wall and railing the whole not more than\\n      five feet high it was perfectly easy therefore for anyone to\\n      get into the garden but the window was entirely inaccessible\\n      since there was no waterpipe or anything which could help the\\n      most active man to climb it more puzzled than ever i retraced\\n      my steps to kensington i had not been in my study five minutes\\n      when the maid entered to say that a person desired to see me to\\n      my astonishment it was none other than my strange old book\\n      collector his sharp wizened face peering out from a frame of\\n      white hair and his precious volumes a dozen of them at least\\n      wedged under his right arm\\n\\n      youre surprised to see me sir said he in a strange\\n      croaking voice\\n\\n      i acknowledged that i was\\n\\n      well ive a conscience sir and when i chanced to see you go\\n      into this house as i came hobbling after you i thought to\\n      myself ill just step in and see that kind gentleman and tell\\n      him that if i was a bit gruff in my manner there was not any harm\\n      meant and that i am much obliged to him for picking up my\\n      books\\n\\n      you make too much of a trifle said i may i ask how you knew\\n      who i was\\n\\n      well sir if it isnt too great a liberty i am a neighbour of\\n      yours for youll find my little bookshop at the corner of church\\n      street and very happy to see you i am sure maybe you collect\\n      yourself sir heres british birds and catullus and the\\n      holy wara bargain every one of them with five volumes you\\n      could just fill that gap on that second shelf it looks untidy\\n      does it not sir\\n\\n      i moved my head to look at the cabinet behind me when i turned\\n      again sherlock holmes was standing smiling at me across my study\\n      table i rose to my feet stared at him for some seconds in utter\\n      amazement and then it appears that i must have fainted for the\\n      first and the last time in my life certainly a grey mist swirled\\n      before my eyes and when it cleared i found my collarends undone\\n      and the tingling aftertaste of brandy upon my lips holmes was\\n      bending over my chair his flask in his hand\\n\\n      my dear watson said the wellremembered voice i owe you a\\n      thousand apologies i had no idea that you would be so affected\\n\\n      i gripped him by the arms\\n\\n      holmes i cried is it really you can it indeed be that you\\n      are alive is it possible that you succeeded in climbing out of\\n      that awful abyss\\n\\n      wait a moment said he are you sure that you are really fit\\n      to discuss things i have given you a serious shock by my\\n      unnecessarily dramatic reappearance\\n\\n      i am all right but indeed holmes i can hardly believe my\\n      eyes good heavens to think that youyou of all menshould be\\n      standing in my study again i gripped him by the sleeve and\\n      felt the thin sinewy arm beneath it well youre not a spirit\\n      anyhow said i my dear chap im overjoyed to see you sit\\n      down and tell me how you came alive out of that dreadful chasm\\n\\n      he sat opposite to me and lit a cigarette in his old nonchalant\\n      manner he was dressed in the seedy frockcoat of the book\\n      merchant but the rest of that individual lay in a pile of white\\n      hair and old books upon the table holmes looked even thinner and\\n      keener than of old but there was a deadwhite tinge in his\\n      aquiline face which told me that his life recently had not been a\\n      healthy one\\n\\n      i am glad to stretch myself watson said he it is no joke\\n      when a tall man has to take a foot off his stature for several\\n      hours on end now my dear fellow in the matter of these\\n      explanations we have if i may ask for your cooperation a hard\\n      and dangerous nights work in front of us perhaps it would be\\n      better if i gave you an account of the whole situation when that\\n      work is finished\\n\\n      i am full of curiosity i should much prefer to hear now\\n\\n      youll come with me tonight\\n\\n      when you like and where you like\\n\\n      this is indeed like the old days we shall have time for a\\n      mouthful of dinner before we need go well then about that\\n      chasm i had no serious difficulty in getting out of it for the\\n      very simple reason that i never was in it\\n\\n      you never were in it\\n\\n      no watson i never was in it my note to you was absolutely\\n      genuine i had little doubt that i had come to the end of my\\n      career when i perceived the somewhat sinister figure of the late\\n      professor moriarty standing upon the narrow pathway which led to\\n      safety i read an inexorable purpose in his grey eyes i\\n      exchanged some remarks with him therefore and obtained his\\n      courteous permission to write the short note which you afterwards\\n      received i left it with my cigarettebox and my stick and i\\n      walked along the pathway moriarty still at my heels when i\\n      reached the end i stood at bay he drew no weapon but he rushed\\n      at me and threw his long arms around me he knew that his own\\n      game was up and was only anxious to revenge himself upon me we\\n      tottered together upon the brink of the fall i have some\\n      knowledge however of baritsu or the japanese system of\\n      wrestling which has more than once been very useful to me i\\n      slipped through his grip and he with a horrible scream kicked\\n      madly for a few seconds and clawed the air with both his hands\\n      but for all his efforts he could not get his balance and over he\\n      went with my face over the brink i saw him fall for a long way\\n      then he struck a rock bounded off and splashed into the water\\n\\n      i listened with amazement to this explanation which holmes\\n      delivered between the puffs of his cigarette\\n\\n      but the tracks i cried i saw with my own eyes that two\\n      went down the path and none returned\\n\\n      it came about in this way the instant that the professor had\\n      disappeared it struck me what a really extraordinarily lucky\\n      chance fate had placed in my way i knew that moriarty was not\\n      the only man who had sworn my death there were at least three\\n      others whose desire for vengeance upon me would only be increased\\n      by the death of their leader they were all most dangerous men\\n      one or other would certainly get me on the other hand if all\\n      the world was convinced that i was dead they would take\\n      liberties these men they would soon lay themselves open and\\n      sooner or later i could destroy them then it would be time for\\n      me to announce that i was still in the land of the living so\\n      rapidly does the brain act that i believe i had thought this all\\n      out before professor moriarty had reached the bottom of the\\n      reichenbach fall\\n\\n      i stood up and examined the rocky wall behind me in your\\n      picturesque account of the matter which i read with great\\n      interest some months later you assert that the wall was sheer\\n      that was not literally true a few small footholds presented\\n      themselves and there was some indication of a ledge the cliff\\n      is so high that to climb it all was an obvious impossibility and\\n      it was equally impossible to make my way along the wet path\\n      without leaving some tracks i might it is true have reversed\\n      my boots as i have done on similar occasions but the sight of\\n      three sets of tracks in one direction would certainly have\\n      suggested a deception on the whole then it was best that i\\n      should risk the climb it was not a pleasant business watson\\n      the fall roared beneath me i am not a fanciful person but i\\n      give you my word that i seemed to hear moriartys voice screaming\\n      at me out of the abyss a mistake would have been fatal more\\n      than once as tufts of grass came out in my hand or my foot\\n      slipped in the wet notches of the rock i thought that i was\\n      gone but i struggled upward and at last i reached a ledge\\n      several feet deep and covered with soft green moss where i could\\n      lie unseen in the most perfect comfort there i was stretched\\n      when you my dear watson and all your following were\\n      investigating in the most sympathetic and inefficient manner the\\n      circumstances of my death\\n\\n      at last when you had all formed your inevitable and totally\\n      erroneous conclusions you departed for the hotel and i was left\\n      alone i had imagined that i had reached the end of my\\n      adventures but a very unexpected occurrence showed me that there\\n      were surprises still in store for me a huge rock falling from\\n      above boomed past me struck the path and bounded over into the\\n      chasm for an instant i thought that it was an accident but a\\n      moment later looking up i saw a mans head against the\\n      darkening sky and another stone struck the very ledge upon which\\n      i was stretched within a foot of my head of course the meaning\\n      of this was obvious moriarty had not been alone a\\n      confederateand even that one glance had told me how dangerous a\\n      man that confederate washad kept guard while the professor had\\n      attacked me from a distance unseen by me he had been a witness\\n      of his friends death and of my escape he had waited and then\\n      making his way round to the top of the cliff he had endeavoured\\n      to succeed where his comrade had failed\\n\\n      i did not take long to think about it watson again i saw that\\n      grim face look over the cliff and i knew that it was the\\n      precursor of another stone i scrambled down on to the path i\\n      dont think i could have done it in cold blood it was a hundred\\n      times more difficult than getting up but i had no time to think\\n      of the danger for another stone sang past me as i hung by my\\n      hands from the edge of the ledge halfway down i slipped but by\\n      the blessing of god i landed torn and bleeding upon the path\\n      i took to my heels did ten miles over the mountains in the\\n      darkness and a week later i found myself in florence with the\\n      certainty that no one in the world knew what had become of me\\n\\n      i had only one confidantmy brother mycroft i owe you many\\n      apologies my dear watson but it was allimportant that it\\n      should be thought i was dead and it is quite certain that you\\n      would not have written so convincing an account of my unhappy end\\n      had you not yourself thought that it was true several times\\n      during the last three years i have taken up my pen to write to\\n      you but always i feared lest your affectionate regard for me\\n      should tempt you to some indiscretion which would betray my\\n      secret for that reason i turned away from you this evening when\\n      you upset my books for i was in danger at the time and any show\\n      of surprise and emotion upon your part might have drawn attention\\n      to my identity and led to the most deplorable and irreparable\\n      results as to mycroft i had to confide in him in order to\\n      obtain the money which i needed the course of events in london\\n      did not run so well as i had hoped for the trial of the moriarty\\n      gang left two of its most dangerous members my own most\\n      vindictive enemies at liberty i travelled for two years in\\n      tibet therefore and amused myself by visiting lhassa and\\n      spending some days with the head lama you may have read of the\\n      remarkable explorations of a norwegian named sigerson but i am\\n      sure that it never occurred to you that you were receiving news\\n      of your friend i then passed through persia looked in at mecca\\n      and paid a short but interesting visit to the khalifa at khartoum\\n      the results of which i have communicated to the foreign office\\n      returning to france i spent some months in a research into the\\n      coaltar derivatives which i conducted in a laboratory at\\n      montpellier in the south of france having concluded this to my\\n      satisfaction and learning that only one of my enemies was now\\n      left in london i was about to return when my movements were\\n      hastened by the news of this very remarkable park lane mystery\\n      which not only appealed to me by its own merits but which seemed\\n      to offer some most peculiar personal opportunities i came over\\n      at once to london called in my own person at baker street threw\\n      mrs hudson into violent hysterics and found that mycroft had\\n      preserved my rooms and my papers exactly as they had always been\\n      so it was my dear watson that at two oclock today i found\\n      myself in my old armchair in my own old room and only wishing\\n      that i could have seen my old friend watson in the other chair\\n      which he has so often adorned\\n\\n      such was the remarkable narrative to which i listened on that\\n      april eveninga narrative which would have been utterly\\n      incredible to me had it not been confirmed by the actual sight of\\n      the tall spare figure and the keen eager face which i had\\n      never thought to see again in some manner he had learned of my\\n      own sad bereavement and his sympathy was shown in his manner\\n      rather than in his words work is the best antidote to sorrow\\n      my dear watson said he and i have a piece of work for us both\\n      tonight which if we can bring it to a successful conclusion\\n      will in itself justify a mans life on this planet in vain i\\n      begged him to tell me more you will hear and see enough before\\n      morning he answered we have three years of the past to\\n      discuss let that suffice until halfpast nine when we start\\n      upon the notable adventure of the empty house\\n\\n      it was indeed like old times when at that hour i found myself\\n      seated beside him in a hansom my revolver in my pocket and the\\n      thrill of adventure in my heart holmes was cold and stern and\\n      silent as the gleam of the streetlamps flashed upon his austere\\n      features i saw that his brows were drawn down in thought and his\\n      thin lips compressed i knew not what wild beast we were about to\\n      hunt down in the dark jungle of criminal london but i was well\\n      assured from the bearing of this master huntsman that the\\n      adventure was a most grave onewhile the sardonic smile which\\n      occasionally broke through his ascetic gloom boded little good\\n      for the object of our quest\\n\\n      i had imagined that we were bound for baker street but holmes\\n      stopped the cab at the corner of cavendish square i observed\\n      that as he stepped out he gave a most searching glance to right\\n      and left and at every subsequent street corner he took the\\n      utmost pains to assure that he was not followed our route was\\n      certainly a singular one holmess knowledge of the byways of\\n      london was extraordinary and on this occasion he passed rapidly\\n      and with an assured step through a network of mews and stables\\n      the very existence of which i had never known we emerged at last\\n      into a small road lined with old gloomy houses which led us\\n      into manchester street and so to blandford street here he\\n      turned swiftly down a narrow passage passed through a wooden\\n      gate into a deserted yard and then opened with a key the back\\n      door of a house we entered together and he closed it behind us\\n\\n      the place was pitch dark but it was evident to me that it was an\\n      empty house our feet creaked and crackled over the bare\\n      planking and my outstretched hand touched a wall from which the\\n      paper was hanging in ribbons holmess cold thin fingers closed\\n      round my wrist and led me forward down a long hall until i dimly\\n      saw the murky fanlight over the door here holmes turned suddenly\\n      to the right and we found ourselves in a large square empty\\n      room heavily shadowed in the corners but faintly lit in the\\n      centre from the lights of the street beyond there was no lamp\\n      near and the window was thick with dust so that we could only\\n      just discern each others figures within my companion put his\\n      hand upon my shoulder and his lips close to my ear\\n\\n      do you know where we are he whispered\\n\\n      surely that is baker street i answered staring through the\\n      dim window\\n\\n      exactly we are in camden house which stands opposite to our\\n      own old quarters\\n\\n      but why are we here\\n\\n      because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque\\n      pile might i trouble you my dear watson to draw a little\\n      nearer to the window taking every precaution not to show\\n      yourself and then to look up at our old roomsthe startingpoint\\n      of so many of your little fairytales we will see if my three\\n      years of absence have entirely taken away my power to surprise\\n      you\\n\\n      i crept forward and looked across at the familiar window as my\\n      eyes fell upon it i gave a gasp and a cry of amazement the\\n      blind was down and a strong light was burning in the room the\\n      shadow of a man who was seated in a chair within was thrown in\\n      hard black outline upon the luminous screen of the window there\\n      was no mistaking the poise of the head the squareness of the\\n      shoulders the sharpness of the features the face was turned\\n      halfround and the effect was that of one of those black\\n      silhouettes which our grandparents loved to frame it was a\\n      perfect reproduction of holmes so amazed was i that i threw out\\n      my hand to make sure that the man himself was standing beside me\\n      he was quivering with silent laughter\\n\\n      well said he\\n\\n      good heavens i cried it is marvellous\\n\\n      i trust that age doth not wither nor custom stale my infinite\\n      variety said he and i recognized in his voice the joy and\\n      pride which the artist takes in his own creation it really is\\n      rather like me is it not\\n\\n      i should be prepared to swear that it was you\\n\\n      the credit of the execution is due to monsieur oscar meunier of\\n      grenoble who spent some days in doing the moulding it is a bust\\n      in wax the rest i arranged myself during my visit to baker\\n      street this afternoon\\n\\n      but why\\n\\n      because my dear watson i had the strongest possible reason for\\n      wishing certain people to think that i was there when i was\\n      really elsewhere\\n\\n      and you thought the rooms were watched\\n\\n      i knew that they were watched\\n\\n      by whom\\n\\n      by my old enemies watson by the charming society whose leader\\n      lies in the reichenbach fall you must remember that they knew\\n      and only they knew that i was still alive sooner or later they\\n      believed that i should come back to my rooms they watched them\\n      continuously and this morning they saw me arrive\\n\\n      how do you know\\n\\n      because i recognized their sentinel when i glanced out of my\\n      window he is a harmless enough fellow parker by name a\\n      garroter by trade and a remarkable performer upon the\\n      jewsharp i cared nothing for him but i cared a great deal for\\n      the much more formidable person who was behind him the bosom\\n      friend of moriarty the man who dropped the rocks over the cliff\\n      the most cunning and dangerous criminal in london that is the\\n      man who is after me tonight watson and that is the man who is\\n      quite unaware that we are after him\\n\\n      my friends plans were gradually revealing themselves from this\\n      convenient retreat the watchers were being watched and the\\n      trackers tracked that angular shadow up yonder was the bait and\\n      we were the hunters in silence we stood together in the darkness\\n      and watched the hurrying figures who passed and repassed in front\\n      of us holmes was silent and motionless but i could tell that he\\n      was keenly alert and that his eyes were fixed intently upon the\\n      stream of passersby it was a bleak and boisterous night and the\\n      wind whistled shrilly down the long street many people were\\n      moving to and fro most of them muffled in their coats and\\n      cravats once or twice it seemed to me that i had seen the same\\n      figure before and i especially noticed two men who appeared to\\n      be sheltering themselves from the wind in the doorway of a house\\n      some distance up the street i tried to draw my companions\\n      attention to them but he gave a little ejaculation of\\n      impatience and continued to stare into the street more than\\n      once he fidgeted with his feet and tapped rapidly with his\\n      fingers upon the wall it was evident to me that he was becoming\\n      uneasy and that his plans were not working out altogether as he\\n      had hoped at last as midnight approached and the street\\n      gradually cleared he paced up and down the room in\\n      uncontrollable agitation i was about to make some remark to him\\n      when i raised my eyes to the lighted window and again\\n      experienced almost as great a surprise as before i clutched\\n      holmess arm and pointed upward\\n\\n      the shadow has moved i cried\\n\\n      it was indeed no longer the profile but the back which was\\n      turned towards us\\n\\n      three years had certainly not smoothed the asperities of his\\n      temper or his impatience with a less active intelligence than his\\n      own\\n\\n      of course it has moved said he am i such a farcical bungler\\n      watson that i should erect an obvious dummy and expect that\\n      some of the sharpest men in europe would be deceived by it we\\n      have been in this room two hours and mrs hudson has made some\\n      change in that figure eight times or once in every quarter of an\\n      hour she works it from the front so that her shadow may never\\n      be seen ah he drew in his breath with a shrill excited\\n      intake in the dim light i saw his head thrown forward his whole\\n      attitude rigid with attention outside the street was absolutely\\n      deserted those two men might still be crouching in the doorway\\n      but i could no longer see them all was still and dark save only\\n      that brilliant yellow screen in front of us with the black figure\\n      outlined upon its centre again in the utter silence i heard that\\n      thin sibilant note which spoke of intense suppressed excitement\\n      an instant later he pulled me back into the blackest corner of\\n      the room and i felt his warning hand upon my lips the fingers\\n      which clutched me were quivering never had i known my friend\\n      more moved and yet the dark street still stretched lonely and\\n      motionless before us\\n\\n      but suddenly i was aware of that which his keener senses had\\n      already distinguished a low stealthy sound came to my ears not\\n      from the direction of baker street but from the back of the very\\n      house in which we lay concealed a door opened and shut an\\n      instant later steps crept down the passagesteps which were meant\\n      to be silent but which reverberated harshly through the empty\\n      house holmes crouched back against the wall and i did the same\\n      my hand closing upon the handle of my revolver peering through\\n      the gloom i saw the vague outline of a man a shade blacker than\\n      the blackness of the open door he stood for an instant and then\\n      he crept forward crouching menacing into the room he was\\n      within three yards of us this sinister figure and i had braced\\n      myself to meet his spring before i realized that he had no idea\\n      of our presence he passed close beside us stole over to the\\n      window and very softly and noiselessly raised it for half a\\n      foot as he sank to the level of this opening the light of the\\n      street no longer dimmed by the dusty glass fell full upon his\\n      face the man seemed to be beside himself with excitement his\\n      two eyes shone like stars and his features were working\\n      convulsively he was an elderly man with a thin projecting\\n      nose a high bald forehead and a huge grizzled moustache an\\n      opera hat was pushed to the back of his head and an evening\\n      dress shirtfront gleamed out through his open overcoat his face\\n      was gaunt and swarthy scored with deep savage lines in his\\n      hand he carried what appeared to be a stick but as he laid it\\n      down upon the floor it gave a metallic clang then from the\\n      pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky object and he busied\\n      himself in some task which ended with a loud sharp click as if\\n      a spring or bolt had fallen into its place still kneeling upon\\n      the floor he bent forward and threw all his weight and strength\\n      upon some lever with the result that there came a long\\n      whirling grinding noise ending once more in a powerful click\\n      he straightened himself then and i saw that what he held in his\\n      hand was a sort of gun with a curiously misshapen butt he\\n      opened it at the breech put something in and snapped the\\n      breechlock then crouching down he rested the end of the\\n      barrel upon the ledge of the open window and i saw his long\\n      moustache droop over the stock and his eye gleam as it peered\\n      along the sights i heard a little sigh of satisfaction as he\\n      cuddled the butt into his shoulder and saw that amazing target\\n      the black man on the yellow ground standing clear at the end of\\n      his foresight for an instant he was rigid and motionless then\\n      his finger tightened on the trigger there was a strange loud\\n      whiz and a long silvery tinkle of broken glass at that instant\\n      holmes sprang like a tiger on to the marksmans back and hurled\\n      him flat upon his face he was up again in a moment and with\\n      convulsive strength he seized holmes by the throat but i struck\\n      him on the head with the butt of my revolver and he dropped\\n      again upon the floor i fell upon him and as i held him my\\n      comrade blew a shrill call upon a whistle there was the clatter\\n      of running feet upon the pavement and two policemen in uniform\\n      with one plainclothes detective rushed through the front\\n      entrance and into the room\\n\\n      that you lestrade said holmes\\n\\n      yes mr holmes i took the job myself its good to see you\\n      back in london sir\\n\\n      i think you want a little unofficial help three undetected\\n      murders in one year wont do lestrade but you handled the\\n      molesey mystery with less than your usualthats to say you\\n      handled it fairly well\\n\\n      we had all risen to our feet our prisoner breathing hard with a\\n      stalwart constable on each side of him already a few loiterers\\n      had begun to collect in the street holmes stepped up to the\\n      window closed it and dropped the blinds lestrade had produced\\n      two candles and the policemen had uncovered their lanterns i\\n      was able at last to have a good look at our prisoner\\n\\n      it was a tremendously virile and yet sinister face which was\\n      turned towards us with the brow of a philosopher above and the\\n      jaw of a sensualist below the man must have started with great\\n      capacities for good or for evil but one could not look upon his\\n      cruel blue eyes with their drooping cynical lids or upon the\\n      fierce aggressive nose and the threatening deeplined brow\\n      without reading natures plainest dangersignals he took no heed\\n      of any of us but his eyes were fixed upon holmess face with an\\n      expression in which hatred and amazement were equally blended\\n      you fiend he kept on muttering you clever clever fiend\\n\\n      ah colonel said holmes arranging his rumpled collar\\n      journeys end in lovers meetings as the old play says i\\n      dont think i have had the pleasure of seeing you since you\\n      favoured me with those attentions as i lay on the ledge above the\\n      reichenbach fall\\n\\n      the colonel still stared at my friend like a man in a trance\\n      you cunning cunning fiend was all that he could say\\n\\n      i have not introduced you yet said holmes this gentlemen\\n      is colonel sebastian moran once of her majestys indian army\\n      and the best heavygame shot that our eastern empire has ever\\n      produced i believe i am correct colonel in saying that your bag\\n      of tigers still remains unrivalled\\n\\n      the fierce old man said nothing but still glared at my\\n      companion with his savage eyes and bristling moustache he was\\n      wonderfully like a tiger himself\\n\\n      i wonder that my very simple stratagem could deceive so old a\\n      shikari said holmes it must be very familiar to you have\\n      you not tethered a young kid under a tree lain above it with\\n      your rifle and waited for the bait to bring up your tiger this\\n      empty house is my tree and you are my tiger you have possibly\\n      had other guns in reserve in case there should be several tigers\\n      or in the unlikely supposition of your own aim failing you\\n      these he pointed around are my other guns the parallel is\\n      exact\\n\\n      colonel moran sprang forward with a snarl of rage but the\\n      constables dragged him back the fury upon his face was terrible\\n      to look at\\n\\n      i confess that you had one small surprise for me said holmes\\n      i did not anticipate that you would yourself make use of this\\n      empty house and this convenient front window i had imagined you\\n      as operating from the street where my friend lestrade and his\\n      merry men were awaiting you with that exception all has gone as\\n      i expected\\n\\n      colonel moran turned to the official detective\\n\\n      you may or may not have just cause for arresting me said he\\n      but at least there can be no reason why i should submit to the\\n      gibes of this person if i am in the hands of the law let things\\n      be done in a legal way\\n\\n      well thats reasonable enough said lestrade nothing further\\n      you have to say mr holmes before we go\\n\\n      holmes had picked up the powerful airgun from the floor and was\\n      examining its mechanism\\n\\n      an admirable and unique weapon said he noiseless and of\\n      tremendous power i knew von herder the blind german mechanic\\n      who constructed it to the order of the late professor moriarty\\n      for years i have been aware of its existence though i have never\\n      before had the opportunity of handling it i commend it very\\n      specially to your attention lestrade and also the bullets which\\n      fit it\\n\\n      you can trust us to look after that mr holmes said lestrade\\n      as the whole party moved towards the door anything further to\\n      say\\n\\n      only to ask what charge you intend to prefer\\n\\n      what charge sir why of course the attempted murder of mr\\n      sherlock holmes\\n\\n      not so lestrade i do not propose to appear in the matter at\\n      all to you and to you only belongs the credit of the\\n      remarkable arrest which you have effected yes lestrade i\\n      congratulate you with your usual happy mixture of cunning and\\n      audacity you have got him\\n\\n      got him got whom mr holmes\\n\\n      the man that the whole force has been seeking in vaincolonel\\n      sebastian moran who shot the honourable ronald adair with an\\n      expanding bullet from an airgun through the open window of the\\n      secondfloor front of no  park lane upon the thirtieth of\\n      last month thats the charge lestrade and now watson if you\\n      can endure the draught from a broken window i think that half an\\n      hour in my study over a cigar may afford you some profitable\\n      amusement\\n\\n      our old chambers had been left unchanged through the supervision\\n      of mycroft holmes and the immediate care of mrs hudson as i\\n      entered i saw it is true an unwonted tidiness but the old\\n      landmarks were all in their place there were the chemical corner\\n      and the acidstained dealtopped table there upon a shelf was\\n      the row of formidable scrapbooks and books of reference which\\n      many of our fellowcitizens would have been so glad to burn the\\n      diagrams the violincase and the piperackeven the persian\\n      slipper which contained the tobaccoall met my eyes as i glanced\\n      round me there were two occupants of the roomone mrs hudson\\n      who beamed upon us both as we enteredthe other the strange\\n      dummy which had played so important a part in the evenings\\n      adventures it was a waxcoloured model of my friend so\\n      admirably done that it was a perfect facsimile it stood on a\\n      small pedestal table with an old dressinggown of holmess so\\n      draped round it that the illusion from the street was absolutely\\n      perfect\\n\\n      i hope you observed all precautions mrs hudson said holmes\\n\\n      i went to it on my knees sir just as you told me\\n\\n      excellent you carried the thing out very well did you observe\\n      where the bullet went\\n\\n      yes sir im afraid it has spoilt your beautiful bust for it\\n      passed right through the head and flattened itself on the wall i\\n      picked it up from the carpet here it is\\n\\n      holmes held it out to me a soft revolver bullet as you\\n      perceive watson theres genius in that for who would expect to\\n      find such a thing fired from an airgun all right mrs hudson i\\n      am much obliged for your assistance and now watson let me see\\n      you in your old seat once more for there are several points\\n      which i should like to discuss with you\\n\\n      he had thrown off the seedy frockcoat and now he was the holmes\\n      of old in the mousecoloured dressinggown which he took from his\\n      effigy\\n\\n      the old shikaris nerves have not lost their steadiness nor\\n      his eyes their keenness said he with a laugh as he inspected\\n      the shattered forehead of his bust\\n\\n      plumb in the middle of the back of the head and smack through\\n      the brain he was the best shot in india and i expect that there\\n      are few better in london have you heard the name\\n\\n      no i have not\\n\\n      well well such is fame but then if i remember right you\\n      had not heard the name of professor james moriarty who had one\\n      of the great brains of the century just give me down my index of\\n      biographies from the shelf\\n\\n      he turned over the pages lazily leaning back in his chair and\\n      blowing great clouds from his cigar\\n\\n      my collection of ms is a fine one said he moriarty himself\\n      is enough to make any letter illustrious and here is morgan the\\n      poisoner and merridew of abominable memory and mathews who\\n      knocked out my left canine in the waitingroom at charing cross\\n      and finally here is our friend of tonight\\n\\n      he handed over the book and i read\\n\\n      moran sebastian colonel unemployed formerly st\\n      bangalore pioneers born london  son of sir augustus moran\\n      cb once british minister to persia educated eton and oxford\\n      served in jowaki campaign afghan campaign charasiab\\n      despatches sherpur and cabul author of heavy game of the\\n      western himalayas  three months in the jungle \\n      address conduit street clubs the angloindian the\\n      tankerville the bagatelle card club\\n\\n      on the margin was written in holmess precise hand\\n\\n      the second most dangerous man in london\\n\\n      this is astonishing said i as i handed back the volume the\\n      mans career is that of an honourable soldier\\n\\n      it is true holmes answered up to a certain point he did\\n      well he was always a man of iron nerve and the story is still\\n      told in india how he crawled down a drain after a wounded\\n      maneating tiger there are some trees watson which grow to a\\n      certain height and then suddenly develop some unsightly\\n      eccentricity you will see it often in humans i have a theory\\n      that the individual represents in his development the whole\\n      procession of his ancestors and that such a sudden turn to good\\n      or evil stands for some strong influence which came into the line\\n      of his pedigree the person becomes as it were the epitome of\\n      the history of his own family\\n\\n      it is surely rather fanciful\\n\\n      well i dont insist upon it whatever the cause colonel moran\\n      began to go wrong without any open scandal he still made india\\n      too hot to hold him he retired came to london and again\\n      acquired an evil name it was at this time that he was sought out\\n      by professor moriarty to whom for a time he was chief of the\\n      staff moriarty supplied him liberally with money and used him\\n      only in one or two very highclass jobs which no ordinary\\n      criminal could have undertaken you may have some recollection of\\n      the death of mrs stewart of lauder in  not well i am\\n      sure moran was at the bottom of it but nothing could be proved\\n      so cleverly was the colonel concealed that even when the\\n      moriarty gang was broken up we could not incriminate him you\\n      remember at that date when i called upon you in your rooms how\\n      i put up the shutters for fear of airguns no doubt you thought\\n      me fanciful i knew exactly what i was doing for i knew of the\\n      existence of this remarkable gun and i knew also that one of the\\n      best shots in the world would be behind it when we were in\\n      switzerland he followed us with moriarty and it was undoubtedly\\n      he who gave me that evil five minutes on the reichenbach ledge\\n\\n      you may think that i read the papers with some attention during\\n      my sojourn in france on the lookout for any chance of laying\\n      him by the heels so long as he was free in london my life would\\n      really not have been worth living night and day the shadow would\\n      have been over me and sooner or later his chance must have come\\n      what could i do i could not shoot him at sight or i should\\n      myself be in the dock there was no use appealing to a\\n      magistrate they cannot interfere on the strength of what would\\n      appear to them to be a wild suspicion so i could do nothing but\\n      i watched the criminal news knowing that sooner or later i\\n      should get him then came the death of this ronald adair my\\n      chance had come at last knowing what i did was it not certain\\n      that colonel moran had done it he had played cards with the lad\\n      he had followed him home from the club he had shot him through\\n      the open window there was not a doubt of it the bullets alone\\n      are enough to put his head in a noose i came over at once i was\\n      seen by the sentinel who would i knew direct the colonels\\n      attention to my presence he could not fail to connect my sudden\\n      return with his crime and to be terribly alarmed i was sure\\n      that he would make an attempt to get me out of the way at once\\n      and would bring round his murderous weapon for that purpose i\\n      left him an excellent mark in the window and having warned the\\n      police that they might be neededby the way watson you spotted\\n      their presence in that doorway with unerring accuracyi took up\\n      what seemed to me to be a judicious post for observation never\\n      dreaming that he would choose the same spot for his attack now\\n      my dear watson does anything remain for me to explain\\n\\n      yes said i you have not made it clear what was colonel\\n      morans motive in murdering the honourable ronald adair\\n\\n      ah my dear watson there we come into those realms of\\n      conjecture where the most logical mind may be at fault each may\\n      form his own hypothesis upon the present evidence and yours is\\n      as likely to be correct as mine\\n\\n      you have formed one then\\n\\n      i think that it is not difficult to explain the facts it came\\n      out in evidence that colonel moran and young adair had between\\n      them won a considerable amount of money now moran undoubtedly\\n      played foulof that i have long been aware i believe that on the\\n      day of the murder adair had discovered that moran was cheating\\n      very likely he had spoken to him privately and had threatened to\\n      expose him unless he voluntarily resigned his membership of the\\n      club and promised not to play cards again it is unlikely that a\\n      youngster like adair would at once make a hideous scandal by\\n      exposing a wellknown man so much older than himself probably he\\n      acted as i suggest the exclusion from his clubs would mean ruin\\n      to moran who lived by his illgotten cardgains he therefore\\n      murdered adair who at the time was endeavouring to work out how\\n      much money he should himself return since he could not profit by\\n      his partners foul play he locked the door lest the ladies\\n      should surprise him and insist upon knowing what he was doing\\n      with these names and coins will it pass\\n\\n      i have no doubt that you have hit upon the truth\\n\\n      it will be verified or disproved at the trial meanwhile come\\n      what may colonel moran will trouble us no more the famous\\n      airgun of von herder will embellish the scotland yard museum\\n      and once again mr sherlock holmes is free to devote his life to\\n      examining those interesting little problems which the complex\\n      life of london so plentifully presents\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe adventure of the norwood builder\\n\\n\\n      from the point of view of the criminal expert said mr\\n      sherlock holmes london has become a singularly uninteresting\\n      city since the death of the late lamented professor moriarty\\n\\n      i can hardly think that you would find many decent citizens to\\n      agree with you i answered\\n\\n      well well i must not be selfish said he with a smile as he\\n      pushed back his chair from the breakfasttable the community is\\n      certainly the gainer and no one the loser save the poor\\n      outofwork specialist whose occupation has gone with that man\\n      in the field ones morning paper presented infinite\\n      possibilities often it was only the smallest trace watson the\\n      faintest indication and yet it was enough to tell me that the\\n      great malignant brain was there as the gentlest tremors of the\\n      edges of the web remind one of the foul spider which lurks in the\\n      centre petty thefts wanton assaults purposeless outrageto the\\n      man who held the clue all could be worked into one connected\\n      whole to the scientific student of the higher criminal world no\\n      capital in europe offered the advantages which london then\\n      possessed but now he shrugged his shoulders in humorous\\n      deprecation of the state of things which he had himself done so\\n      much to produce\\n\\n      at the time of which i speak holmes had been back for some\\n      months and i at his request had sold my practice and returned to\\n      share the old quarters in baker street a young doctor named\\n      verner had purchased my small kensington practice and given\\n      with astonishingly little demur the highest price that i ventured\\n      to askan incident which only explained itself some years later\\n      when i found that verner was a distant relation of holmes and\\n      that it was my friend who had really found the money\\n\\n      our months of partnership had not been so uneventful as he had\\n      stated for i find on looking over my notes that this period\\n      includes the case of the papers of expresident murillo and also\\n      the shocking affair of the dutch steamship friesland which so\\n      nearly cost us both our lives his cold and proud nature was\\n      always averse however from anything in the shape of public\\n      applause and he bound me in the most stringent terms to say no\\n      further word of himself his methods or his successesa\\n      prohibition which as i have explained has only now been\\n      removed\\n\\n      mr sherlock holmes was leaning back in his chair after his\\n      whimsical protest and was unfolding his morning paper in a\\n      leisurely fashion when our attention was arrested by a\\n      tremendous ring at the bell followed immediately by a hollow\\n      drumming sound as if someone were beating on the outer door with\\n      his fist as it opened there came a tumultuous rush into the\\n      hall rapid feet clattered up the stair and an instant later a\\n      wildeyed and frantic young man pale disheveled and\\n      palpitating burst into the room he looked from one to the other\\n      of us and under our gaze of inquiry he became conscious that\\n      some apology was needed for this unceremonious entry\\n\\n      im sorry mr holmes he cried you mustnt blame me i am\\n      nearly mad mr holmes i am the unhappy john hector mcfarlane\\n\\n      he made the announcement as if the name alone would explain both\\n      his visit and its manner but i could see by my companions\\n      unresponsive face that it meant no more to him than to me\\n\\n      have a cigarette mr mcfarlane said he pushing his case\\n      across i am sure that with your symptoms my friend dr watson\\n      here would prescribe a sedative the weather has been so very\\n      warm these last few days now if you feel a little more\\n      composed i should be glad if you would sit down in that chair\\n      and tell us very slowly and quietly who you are and what it is\\n      that you want you mentioned your name as if i should recognize\\n      it but i assure you that beyond the obvious facts that you are\\n      a bachelor a solicitor a freemason and an asthmatic i know\\n      nothing whatever about you\\n\\n      familiar as i was with my friends methods it was not difficult\\n      for me to follow his deductions and to observe the untidiness of\\n      attire the sheaf of legal papers the watchcharm and the\\n      breathing which had prompted them our client however stared in\\n      amazement\\n\\n      yes i am all that mr holmes and in addition i am the most\\n      unfortunate man at this moment in london for heavens sake\\n      dont abandon me mr holmes if they come to arrest me before i\\n      have finished my story make them give me time so that i may\\n      tell you the whole truth i could go to jail happy if i knew that\\n      you were working for me outside\\n\\n      arrest you said holmes this is really most gratimost\\n      interesting on what charge do you expect to be arrested\\n\\n      upon the charge of murdering mr jonas oldacre of lower\\n      norwood\\n\\n      my companions expressive face showed a sympathy which was not i\\n      am afraid entirely unmixed with satisfaction\\n\\n      dear me said he it was only this moment at breakfast that i\\n      was saying to my friend dr watson that sensational cases had\\n      disappeared out of our papers\\n\\n      our visitor stretched forward a quivering hand and picked up the\\n      daily telegraph which still lay upon holmess knee\\n\\n      if you had looked at it sir you would have seen at a glance\\n      what the errand is on which i have come to you this morning i\\n      feel as if my name and my misfortune must be in every mans\\n      mouth he turned it over to expose the central page here it\\n      is and with your permission i will read it to you listen to\\n      this mr holmes the headlines are mysterious affair at lower\\n      norwood disappearance of a wellknown builder suspicion of\\n      murder and arson a clue to the criminal that is the clue which\\n      they are already following mr holmes and i know that it leads\\n      infallibly to me i have been followed from london bridge\\n      station and i am sure that they are only waiting for the warrant\\n      to arrest me it will break my mothers heartit will break her\\n      heart he wrung his hands in an agony of apprehension and\\n      swayed backward and forward in his chair\\n\\n      i looked with interest upon this man who was accused of being\\n      the perpetrator of a crime of violence he was flaxenhaired and\\n      handsome in a washedout negative fashion with frightened blue\\n      eyes and a cleanshaven face with a weak sensitive mouth his\\n      age may have been about twentyseven his dress and bearing that\\n      of a gentleman from the pocket of his light summer overcoat\\n      protruded the bundle of indorsed papers which proclaimed his\\n      profession\\n\\n      we must use what time we have said holmes watson would you\\n      have the kindness to take the paper and to read the paragraph in\\n      question\\n\\n      underneath the vigorous headlines which our client had quoted i\\n      read the following suggestive narrative\\n\\n      late last night or early this morning an incident occurred at\\n      lower norwood which points it is feared to a serious crime mr\\n      jonas oldacre is a wellknown resident of that suburb where he\\n      has carried on his business as a builder for many years mr\\n      oldacre is a bachelor fiftytwo years of age and lives in deep\\n      dene house at the sydenham end of the road of that name he has\\n      had the reputation of being a man of eccentric habits secretive\\n      and retiring for some years he has practically withdrawn from\\n      the business in which he is said to have massed considerable\\n      wealth a small timberyard still exists however at the back of\\n      the house and last night about twelve oclock an alarm was\\n      given that one of the stacks was on fire the engines were soon\\n      upon the spot but the dry wood burned with great fury and it\\n      was impossible to arrest the conflagration until the stack had\\n      been entirely consumed up to this point the incident bore the\\n      appearance of an ordinary accident but fresh indications seem to\\n      point to serious crime surprise was expressed at the absence of\\n      the master of the establishment from the scene of the fire and\\n      an inquiry followed which showed that he had disappeared from\\n      the house an examination of his room revealed that the bed had\\n      not been slept in that a safe which stood in it was open that a\\n      number of important papers were scattered about the room and\\n      finally that there were signs of a murderous struggle slight\\n      traces of blood being found within the room and an oaken\\n      walkingstick which also showed stains of blood upon the handle\\n      it is known that mr jonas oldacre had received a late visitor in\\n      his bedroom upon that night and the stick found has been\\n      identified as the property of this person who is a young london\\n      solicitor named john hector mcfarlane junior partner of graham\\n      and mcfarlane of  gresham buildings ec the police believe\\n      that they have evidence in their possession which supplies a very\\n      convincing motive for the crime and altogether it cannot be\\n      doubted that sensational developments will follow\\n          laterit is rumoured as we go to press that mr john hector\\n          mcfarlane has actually been arrested on the charge of the\\n          murder of mr jonas oldacre it is at least certain that a\\n          warrant has been issued there have been further and sinister\\n          developments in the investigation at norwood besides the\\n          signs of a struggle in the room of the unfortunate builder it\\n          is now known that the french windows of his bedroom which is\\n          on the ground floor were found to be open that there were\\n          marks as if some bulky object had been dragged across to the\\n          woodpile and finally it is asserted that charred remains\\n          have been found among the charcoal ashes of the fire the\\n          police theory is that a most sensational crime has been\\n          committed that the victim was clubbed to death in his own\\n          bedroom his papers rifled and his dead body dragged across\\n          to the woodstack which was then ignited so as to hide all\\n          traces of the crime the conduct of the criminal\\n          investigation has been left in the experienced hands of\\n          inspector lestrade of scotland yard who is following up the\\n          clues with his accustomed energy and sagacity\\n\\n      sherlock holmes listened with closed eyes and fingertips together\\n      to this remarkable account\\n\\n      the case has certainly some points of interest said he in his\\n      languid fashion may i ask in the first place mr mcfarlane\\n      how it is that you are still at liberty since there appears to\\n      be enough evidence to justify your arrest\\n\\n      i live at torrington lodge blackheath with my parents mr\\n      holmes but last night having to do business very late with mr\\n      jonas oldacre i stayed at an hotel in norwood and came to my\\n      business from there i knew nothing of this affair until i was in\\n      the train when i read what you have just heard i at once saw\\n      the horrible danger of my position and i hurried to put the case\\n      into your hands i have no doubt that i should have been arrested\\n      either at my city office or at my home a man followed me from\\n      london bridge station and i have no doubtgreat heaven what is\\n      that\\n\\n      it was a clang of the bell followed instantly by heavy steps\\n      upon the stair a moment later our old friend lestrade appeared\\n      in the doorway over his shoulder i caught a glimpse of one or\\n      two uniformed policemen outside\\n\\n      mr john hector mcfarlane said lestrade\\n\\n      our unfortunate client rose with a ghastly face\\n\\n      i arrest you for the wilful murder of mr jonas oldacre of\\n      lower norwood\\n\\n      mcfarlane turned to us with a gesture of despair and sank into\\n      his chair once more like one who is crushed\\n\\n      one moment lestrade said holmes half an hour more or less\\n      can make no difference to you and the gentleman was about to\\n      give us an account of this very interesting affair which might\\n      aid us in clearing it up\\n\\n      i think there will be no difficulty in clearing it up said\\n      lestrade grimly\\n\\n      none the less with your permission i should be much interested\\n      to hear his account\\n\\n      well mr holmes it is difficult for me to refuse you anything\\n      for you have been of use to the force once or twice in the past\\n      and we owe you a good turn at scotland yard said lestrade at\\n      the same time i must remain with my prisoner and i am bound to\\n      warn him that anything he may say will appear in evidence against\\n      him\\n\\n      i wish nothing better said our client all i ask is that you\\n      should hear and recognize the absolute truth\\n\\n      lestrade looked at his watch ill give you half an hour said\\n      he\\n\\n      i must explain first said mcfarlane that i knew nothing of\\n      mr jonas oldacre his name was familiar to me for many years\\n      ago my parents were acquainted with him but they drifted apart\\n      i was very much surprised therefore when yesterday about three\\n      oclock in the afternoon he walked into my office in the city\\n      but i was still more astonished when he told me the object of his\\n      visit he had in his hand several sheets of a notebook covered\\n      with scribbled writinghere they areand he laid them on my\\n      table\\n\\n      here is my will said he i want you mr mcfarlane to cast\\n      it into proper legal shape i will sit here while you do so\\n\\n      i set myself to copy it and you can imagine my astonishment\\n      when i found that with some reservations he had left all his\\n      property to me he was a strange little ferretlike man with\\n      white eyelashes and when i looked up at him i found his keen\\n      grey eyes fixed upon me with an amused expression i could hardly\\n      believe my own as i read the terms of the will but he explained\\n      that he was a bachelor with hardly any living relation that he\\n      had known my parents in his youth and that he had always heard\\n      of me as a very deserving young man and was assured that his\\n      money would be in worthy hands of course i could only stammer\\n      out my thanks the will was duly finished signed and witnessed\\n      by my clerk this is it on the blue paper and these slips as i\\n      have explained are the rough draft mr jonas oldacre then\\n      informed me that there were a number of documentsbuilding\\n      leases titledeeds mortgages scrip and so forthwhich it was\\n      necessary that i should see and understand he said that his mind\\n      would not be easy until the whole thing was settled and he\\n      begged me to come out to his house at norwood that night\\n      bringing the will with me and to arrange matters remember my\\n      boy not one word to your parents about the affair until\\n      everything is settled we will keep it as a little surprise for\\n      them he was very insistent upon this point and made me promise\\n      it faithfully\\n\\n      you can imagine mr holmes that i was not in a humour to\\n      refuse him anything that he might ask he was my benefactor and\\n      all my desire was to carry out his wishes in every particular i\\n      sent a telegram home therefore to say that i had important\\n      business on hand and that it was impossible for me to say how\\n      late i might be mr oldacre had told me that he would like me to\\n      have supper with him at nine as he might not be home before that\\n      hour i had some difficulty in finding his house however and it\\n      was nearly halfpast before i reached it i found him\\n\\n      one moment said holmes who opened the door\\n\\n      a middleaged woman who was i suppose his housekeeper\\n\\n      and it was she i presume who mentioned your name\\n\\n      exactly said mcfarlane\\n\\n      pray proceed\\n\\n      mcfarlane wiped his damp brow and then continued his narrative\\n\\n      i was shown by this woman into a sittingroom where a frugal\\n      supper was laid out afterwards mr jonas oldacre led me into\\n      his bedroom in which there stood a heavy safe this he opened\\n      and took out a mass of documents which we went over together it\\n      was between eleven and twelve when we finished he remarked that\\n      we must not disturb the housekeeper he showed me out through his\\n      own french window which had been open all this time\\n\\n      was the blind down asked holmes\\n\\n      i will not be sure but i believe that it was only half down\\n      yes i remember how he pulled it up in order to swing open the\\n      window i could not find my stick and he said never mind my\\n      boy i shall see a good deal of you now i hope and i will keep\\n      your stick until you come back to claim it i left him there\\n      the safe open and the papers made up in packets upon the table\\n      it was so late that i could not get back to blackheath so i\\n      spent the night at the anerley arms and i knew nothing more\\n      until i read of this horrible affair in the morning\\n\\n      anything more that you would like to ask mr holmes said\\n      lestrade whose eyebrows had gone up once or twice during this\\n      remarkable explanation\\n\\n      not until i have been to blackheath\\n\\n      you mean to norwood said lestrade\\n\\n      oh yes no doubt that is what i must have meant said holmes\\n      with his enigmatical smile lestrade had learned by more\\n      experiences than he would care to acknowledge that that brain\\n      could cut through that which was impenetrable to him i saw him\\n      look curiously at my companion\\n\\n      i think i should like to have a word with you presently mr\\n      sherlock holmes said he now mr mcfarlane two of my\\n      constables are at the door and there is a fourwheeler waiting\\n      the wretched young man arose and with a last beseeching glance\\n      at us walked from the room the officers conducted him to the\\n      cab but lestrade remained\\n\\n      holmes had picked up the pages which formed the rough draft of\\n      the will and was looking at them with the keenest interest upon\\n      his face\\n\\n      there are some points about that document lestrade are there\\n      not said he pushing them over\\n\\n      the official looked at them with a puzzled expression\\n\\n      i can read the first few lines and these in the middle of the\\n      second page and one or two at the end those are as clear as\\n      print said he but the writing in between is very bad and\\n      there are three places where i cannot read it at all\\n\\n      what do you make of that said holmes\\n\\n      well what do you make of it\\n\\n      that it was written in a train the good writing represents\\n      stations the bad writing movement and the very bad writing\\n      passing over points a scientific expert would pronounce at once\\n      that this was drawn up on a suburban line since nowhere save in\\n      the immediate vicinity of a great city could there be so quick a\\n      succession of points granting that his whole journey was\\n      occupied in drawing up the will then the train was an express\\n      only stopping once between norwood and london bridge\\n\\n      lestrade began to laugh\\n\\n      you are too many for me when you begin to get on your theories\\n      mr holmes said he how does this bear on the case\\n\\n      well it corroborates the young mans story to the extent that\\n      the will was drawn up by jonas oldacre in his journey yesterday\\n      it is curiousis it notthat a man should draw up so important a\\n      document in so haphazard a fashion it suggests that he did not\\n      think it was going to be of much practical importance if a man\\n      drew up a will which he did not intend ever to be effective he\\n      might do it so\\n\\n      well he drew up his own death warrant at the same time said\\n      lestrade\\n\\n      oh you think so\\n\\n      dont you\\n\\n      well it is quite possible but the case is not clear to me\\n      yet\\n\\n      not clear well if that isnt clear what could be clearer\\n      here is a young man who learns suddenly that if a certain older\\n      man dies he will succeed to a fortune what does he do he says\\n      nothing to anyone but he arranges that he shall go out on some\\n      pretext to see his client that night he waits until the only\\n      other person in the house is in bed and then in the solitude of\\n      a mans room he murders him burns his body in the woodpile and\\n      departs to a neighbouring hotel the bloodstains in the room and\\n      also on the stick are very slight it is probable that he\\n      imagined his crime to be a bloodless one and hoped that if the\\n      body were consumed it would hide all traces of the method of his\\n      deathtraces which for some reason must have pointed to him is\\n      not all this obvious\\n\\n      it strikes me my good lestrade as being just a trifle too\\n      obvious said holmes you do not add imagination to your other\\n      great qualities but if you could for one moment put yourself in\\n      the place of this young man would you choose the very night\\n      after the will had been made to commit your crime would it not\\n      seem dangerous to you to make so very close a relation between\\n      the two incidents again would you choose an occasion when you\\n      are known to be in the house when a servant has let you in and\\n      finally would you take the great pains to conceal the body and\\n      yet leave your own stick as a sign that you were the criminal\\n      confess lestrade that all this is very unlikely\\n\\n      as to the stick mr holmes you know as well as i do that a\\n      criminal is often flurried and does such things which a cool\\n      man would avoid he was very likely afraid to go back to the\\n      room give me another theory that would fit the facts\\n\\n      i could very easily give you half a dozen said holmes here\\n      for example is a very possible and even probable one i make you\\n      a free present of it the older man is showing documents which\\n      are of evident value a passing tramp sees them through the\\n      window the blind of which is only half down exit the solicitor\\n      enter the tramp he seizes a stick which he observes there\\n      kills oldacre and departs after burning the body\\n\\n      why should the tramp burn the body\\n\\n      for the matter of that why should mcfarlane\\n\\n      to hide some evidence\\n\\n      possibly the tramp wanted to hide that any murder at all had\\n      been committed\\n\\n      and why did the tramp take nothing\\n\\n      because they were papers that he could not negotiate\\n\\n      lestrade shook his head though it seemed to me that his manner\\n      was less absolutely assured than before\\n\\n      well mr sherlock holmes you may look for your tramp and\\n      while you are finding him we will hold on to our man the future\\n      will show which is right just notice this point mr holmes\\n      that so far as we know none of the papers were removed and that\\n      the prisoner is the one man in the world who had no reason for\\n      removing them since he was heiratlaw and would come into them\\n      in any case\\n\\n      my friend seemed struck by this remark\\n\\n      i dont mean to deny that the evidence is in some ways very\\n      strongly in favour of your theory said he i only wish to\\n      point out that there are other theories possible as you say the\\n      future will decide goodmorning i dare say that in the course\\n      of the day i shall drop in at norwood and see how you are getting\\n      on\\n\\n      when the detective departed my friend rose and made his\\n      preparations for the days work with the alert air of a man who\\n      has a congenial task before him\\n\\n      my first movement watson said he as he bustled into his\\n      frockcoat must as i said be in the direction of blackheath\\n\\n      and why not norwood\\n\\n      because we have in this case one singular incident coming close\\n      to the heels of another singular incident the police are making\\n      the mistake of concentrating their attention upon the second\\n      because it happens to be the one which is actually criminal but\\n      it is evident to me that the logical way to approach the case is\\n      to begin by trying to throw some light upon the first\\n      incidentthe curious will so suddenly made and to so unexpected\\n      an heir it may do something to simplify what followed no my\\n      dear fellow i dont think you can help me there is no prospect\\n      of danger or i should not dream of stirring out without you i\\n      trust that when i see you in the evening i will be able to\\n      report that i have been able to do something for this unfortunate\\n      youngster who has thrown himself upon my protection\\n\\n      it was late when my friend returned and i could see by a glance\\n      at his haggard and anxious face that the high hopes with which\\n      he had started had not been fulfilled for an hour he droned away\\n      upon his violin endeavouring to soothe his own ruffled spirits\\n      at last he flung down the instrument and plunged into a detailed\\n      account of his misadventures\\n\\n      its all going wrong watsonall as wrong as it can go i kept a\\n      bold face before lestrade but upon my soul i believe that for\\n      once the fellow is on the right track and we are on the wrong\\n      all my instincts are one way and all the facts are the other\\n      and i much fear that british juries have not yet attained that\\n      pitch of intelligence when they will give the preference to my\\n      theories over lestrades facts\\n\\n      did you go to blackheath\\n\\n      yes watson i went there and i found very quickly that the\\n      late lamented oldacre was a pretty considerable blackguard the\\n      father was away in search of his son the mother was at homea\\n      little fluffy blueeyed person in a tremor of fear and\\n      indignation of course she would not admit even the possibility\\n      of his guilt but she would not express either surprise or regret\\n      over the fate of oldacre on the contrary she spoke of him with\\n      such bitterness that she was unconsciously considerably\\n      strengthening the case of the police for of course if her son\\n      had heard her speak of the man in this fashion it would\\n      predispose him towards hatred and violence he was more like a\\n      malignant and cunning ape than a human being said she and he\\n      always was ever since he was a young man\\n\\n      you knew him at that time said i\\n\\n      yes i knew him well in fact he was an old suitor of mine\\n      thank heaven that i had the sense to turn away from him and to\\n      marry a better if poorer man i was engaged to him mr holmes\\n      when i heard a shocking story of how he had turned a cat loose in\\n      an aviary and i was so horrified at his brutal cruelty that i\\n      would have nothing more to do with him she rummaged in a\\n      bureau and presently she produced a photograph of a woman\\n      shamefully defaced and mutilated with a knife that is my own\\n      photograph she said he sent it to me in that state with his\\n      curse upon my wedding morning\\n\\n      well said i at least he has forgiven you now since he has\\n      left all his property to your son\\n\\n      neither my son nor i want anything from jonas oldacre dead or\\n      alive she cried with a proper spirit there is a god in\\n      heaven mr holmes and that same god who has punished that\\n      wicked man will show in his own good time that my sons hands\\n      are guiltless of his blood\\n\\n      well i tried one or two leads but could get at nothing which\\n      would help our hypothesis and several points which would make\\n      against it i gave it up at last and off i went to norwood\\n\\n      this place deep dene house is a big modern villa of staring\\n      brick standing back in its own grounds with a laurelclumped\\n      lawn in front of it to the right and some distance back from the\\n      road was the timberyard which had been the scene of the fire\\n      heres a rough plan on a leaf of my notebook this window on the\\n      left is the one which opens into oldacres room you can look\\n      into it from the road you see that is about the only bit of\\n      consolation i have had today lestrade was not there but his\\n      head constable did the honours they had just found a great\\n      treasuretrove they had spent the morning raking among the ashes\\n      of the burned woodpile and besides the charred organic remains\\n      they had secured several discoloured metal discs i examined them\\n      with care and there was no doubt that they were trouser buttons\\n      i even distinguished that one of them was marked with the name of\\n      hyams who was oldacres tailor i then worked the lawn very\\n      carefully for signs and traces but this drought has made\\n      everything as hard as iron nothing was to be seen save that some\\n      body or bundle had been dragged through a low privet hedge which\\n      is in a line with the woodpile all that of course fits in\\n      with the official theory i crawled about the lawn with an august\\n      sun on my back but i got up at the end of an hour no wiser than\\n      before\\n\\n      well after this fiasco i went into the bedroom and examined\\n      that also the bloodstains were very slight mere smears and\\n      discolourations but undoubtedly fresh the stick had been\\n      removed but there also the marks were slight there is no doubt\\n      about the stick belonging to our client he admits it footmarks\\n      of both men could be made out on the carpet but none of any\\n      third person which again is a trick for the other side they\\n      were piling up their score all the time and we were at a\\n      standstill\\n\\n      only one little gleam of hope did i getand yet it amounted to\\n      nothing i examined the contents of the safe most of which had\\n      been taken out and left on the table the papers had been made up\\n      into sealed envelopes one or two of which had been opened by the\\n      police they were not so far as i could judge of any great\\n      value nor did the bankbook show that mr oldacre was in such\\n      very affluent circumstances but it seemed to me that all the\\n      papers were not there there were allusions to some\\n      deedspossibly the more valuablewhich i could not find this of\\n      course if we could definitely prove it would turn lestrades\\n      argument against himself for who would steal a thing if he knew\\n      that he would shortly inherit it\\n\\n      finally having drawn every other cover and picked up no scent\\n      i tried my luck with the housekeeper mrs lexington is her\\n      namea little dark silent person with suspicious and sidelong\\n      eyes she could tell us something if she wouldi am convinced of\\n      it but she was as close as wax yes she had let mr mcfarlane\\n      in at halfpast nine she wished her hand had withered before she\\n      had done so she had gone to bed at halfpast ten her room was\\n      at the other end of the house and she could hear nothing of what\\n      had passed mr mcfarlane had left his hat and to the best of\\n      her belief his stick in the hall she had been awakened by the\\n      alarm of fire her poor dear master had certainly been murdered\\n      had he any enemies well every man had enemies but mr oldacre\\n      kept himself very much to himself and only met people in the way\\n      of business she had seen the buttons and was sure that they\\n      belonged to the clothes which he had worn last night the\\n      woodpile was very dry for it had not rained for a month it\\n      burned like tinder and by the time she reached the spot nothing\\n      could be seen but flames she and all the firemen smelled the\\n      burned flesh from inside it she knew nothing of the papers nor\\n      of mr oldacres private affairs\\n\\n      so my dear watson theres my report of a failure and yetand\\n      yet he clenched his thin hands in a paroxysm of convictioni\\n      know its all wrong i feel it in my bones there is something\\n      that has not come out and that housekeeper knows it there was a\\n      sort of sulky defiance in her eyes which only goes with guilty\\n      knowledge however theres no good talking any more about it\\n      watson but unless some lucky chance comes our way i fear that\\n      the norwood disappearance case will not figure in that chronicle\\n      of our successes which i foresee that a patient public will\\n      sooner or later have to endure\\n\\n      surely said i the mans appearance would go far with any\\n      jury\\n\\n      that is a dangerous argument my dear watson you remember that\\n      terrible murderer bert stevens who wanted us to get him off in\\n       was there ever a more mildmannered sundayschool young\\n      man\\n\\n      it is true\\n\\n      unless we succeed in establishing an alternative theory this\\n      man is lost you can hardly find a flaw in the case which can now\\n      be presented against him and all further investigation has\\n      served to strengthen it by the way there is one curious little\\n      point about those papers which may serve us as the startingpoint\\n      for an inquiry on looking over the bankbook i found that the\\n      low state of the balance was principally due to large checks\\n      which have been made out during the last year to mr cornelius i\\n      confess that i should be interested to know who this mr\\n      cornelius may be with whom a retired builder has such very large\\n      transactions is it possible that he has had a hand in the\\n      affair cornelius might be a broker but we have found no scrip\\n      to correspond with these large payments failing any other\\n      indication my researches must now take the direction of an\\n      inquiry at the bank for the gentleman who has cashed these\\n      checks but i fear my dear fellow that our case will end\\n      ingloriously by lestrade hanging our client which will certainly\\n      be a triumph for scotland yard\\n\\n      i do not know how far sherlock holmes took any sleep that night\\n      but when i came down to breakfast i found him pale and harassed\\n      his bright eyes the brighter for the dark shadows round them the\\n      carpet round his chair was littered with cigaretteends and with\\n      the early editions of the morning papers an open telegram lay\\n      upon the table\\n\\n      what do you think of this watson he asked tossing it across\\n\\n      it was from norwood and ran as follows\\n\\n      important fresh evidence to hand mcfarlanes guilt definitely\\n      established advise you to abandon caselestrade\\n\\n      this sounds serious said i\\n\\n      it is lestrades little cockadoodle of victory holmes\\n      answered with a bitter smile and yet it may be premature to\\n      abandon the case after all important fresh evidence is a\\n      twoedged thing and may possibly cut in a very different\\n      direction to that which lestrade imagines take your breakfast\\n      watson and we will go out together and see what we can do i\\n      feel as if i shall need your company and your moral support\\n      today\\n\\n      my friend had no breakfast himself for it was one of his\\n      peculiarities that in his more intense moments he would permit\\n      himself no food and i have known him presume upon his iron\\n      strength until he has fainted from pure inanition at present i\\n      cannot spare energy and nerve force for digestion he would say\\n      in answer to my medical remonstrances i was not surprised\\n      therefore when this morning he left his untouched meal behind\\n      him and started with me for norwood a crowd of morbid\\n      sightseers were still gathered round deep dene house which was\\n      just such a suburban villa as i had pictured within the gates\\n      lestrade met us his face flushed with victory his manner\\n      grossly triumphant\\n\\n      well mr holmes have you proved us to be wrong yet have you\\n      found your tramp he cried\\n\\n      i have formed no conclusion whatever my companion answered\\n\\n      but we formed ours yesterday and now it proves to be correct\\n      so you must acknowledge that we have been a little in front of\\n      you this time mr holmes\\n\\n      you certainly have the air of something unusual having\\n      occurred said holmes\\n\\n      lestrade laughed loudly\\n\\n      you dont like being beaten any more than the rest of us do\\n      said he a man cant expect always to have it his own way can\\n      he dr watson step this way if you please gentlemen and i\\n      think i can convince you once for all that it was john mcfarlane\\n      who did this crime\\n\\n      he led us through the passage and out into a dark hall beyond\\n\\n      this is where young mcfarlane must have come out to get his hat\\n      after the crime was done said he now look at this with\\n      dramatic suddenness he struck a match and by its light exposed a\\n      stain of blood upon the whitewashed wall as he held the match\\n      nearer i saw that it was more than a stain it was the\\n      wellmarked print of a thumb\\n\\n      look at that with your magnifying glass mr holmes\\n\\n      yes i am doing so\\n\\n      you are aware that no two thumbmarks are alike\\n\\n      i have heard something of the kind\\n\\n      well then will you please compare that print with this wax\\n      impression of young mcfarlanes right thumb taken by my orders\\n      this morning\\n\\n      as he held the waxen print close to the bloodstain it did not\\n      take a magnifying glass to see that the two were undoubtedly from\\n      the same thumb it was evident to me that our unfortunate client\\n      was lost\\n\\n      that is final said lestrade\\n\\n      yes that is final i involuntarily echoed\\n\\n      it is final said holmes\\n\\n      something in his tone caught my ear and i turned to look at him\\n      an extraordinary change had come over his face it was writhing\\n      with inward merriment his two eyes were shining like stars it\\n      seemed to me that he was making desperate efforts to restrain a\\n      convulsive attack of laughter\\n\\n      dear me dear me he said at last well now who would have\\n      thought it and how deceptive appearances may be to be sure\\n      such a nice young man to look at it is a lesson to us not to\\n      trust our own judgment is it not lestrade\\n\\n      yes some of us are a little too much inclined to be cocksure\\n      mr holmes said lestrade the mans insolence was maddening\\n      but we could not resent it\\n\\n      what a providential thing that this young man should press his\\n      right thumb against the wall in taking his hat from the peg such\\n      a very natural action too if you come to think of it holmes\\n      was outwardly calm but his whole body gave a wriggle of\\n      suppressed excitement as he spoke\\n\\n      by the way lestrade who made this remarkable discovery\\n\\n      it was the housekeeper mrs lexington who drew the night\\n      constables attention to it\\n\\n      where was the night constable\\n\\n      he remained on guard in the bedroom where the crime was\\n      committed so as to see that nothing was touched\\n\\n      but why didnt the police see this mark yesterday\\n\\n      well we had no particular reason to make a careful examination\\n      of the hall besides its not in a very prominent place as you\\n      see\\n\\n      no noof course not i suppose there is no doubt that the mark\\n      was there yesterday\\n\\n      lestrade looked at holmes as if he thought he was going out of\\n      his mind i confess that i was myself surprised both at his\\n      hilarious manner and at his rather wild observation\\n\\n      i dont know whether you think that mcfarlane came out of jail\\n      in the dead of the night in order to strengthen the evidence\\n      against himself said lestrade i leave it to any expert in the\\n      world whether that is not the mark of his thumb\\n\\n      it is unquestionably the mark of his thumb\\n\\n      there thats enough said lestrade i am a practical man mr\\n      holmes and when i have got my evidence i come to my conclusions\\n      if you have anything to say you will find me writing my report\\n      in the sittingroom\\n\\n      holmes had recovered his equanimity though i still seemed to\\n      detect gleams of amusement in his expression\\n\\n      dear me this is a very sad development watson is it not\\n      said he and yet there are singular points about it which hold\\n      out some hopes for our client\\n\\n      i am delighted to hear it said i heartily i was afraid it\\n      was all up with him\\n\\n      i would hardly go so far as to say that my dear watson the\\n      fact is that there is one really serious flaw in this evidence to\\n      which our friend attaches so much importance\\n\\n      indeed holmes what is it\\n\\n      only this that i know that that mark was not there when i\\n      examined the hall yesterday and now watson let us have a\\n      little stroll round in the sunshine\\n\\n      with a confused brain but with a heart into which some warmth of\\n      hope was returning i accompanied my friend in a walk round the\\n      garden holmes took each face of the house in turn and examined\\n      it with great interest he then led the way inside and went over\\n      the whole building from basement to attic most of the rooms were\\n      unfurnished but none the less holmes inspected them all\\n      minutely finally on the top corridor which ran outside three\\n      untenanted bedrooms he again was seized with a spasm of\\n      merriment\\n\\n      there are really some very unique features about this case\\n      watson said he i think it is time now that we took our friend\\n      lestrade into our confidence he has had his little smile at our\\n      expense and perhaps we may do as much by him if my reading of\\n      this problem proves to be correct yes yes i think i see how we\\n      should approach it\\n\\n      the scotland yard inspector was still writing in the parlour when\\n      holmes interrupted him\\n\\n      i understood that you were writing a report of this case said\\n      he\\n\\n      so i am\\n\\n      dont you think it may be a little premature i cant help\\n      thinking that your evidence is not complete\\n\\n      lestrade knew my friend too well to disregard his words he laid\\n      down his pen and looked curiously at him\\n\\n      what do you mean mr holmes\\n\\n      only that there is an important witness whom you have not seen\\n\\n      can you produce him\\n\\n      i think i can\\n\\n      then do so\\n\\n      i will do my best how many constables have you\\n\\n      there are three within call\\n\\n      excellent said holmes may i ask if they are all large\\n      ablebodied men with powerful voices\\n\\n      i have no doubt they are though i fail to see what their voices\\n      have to do with it\\n\\n      perhaps i can help you to see that and one or two other things\\n      as well said holmes kindly summon your men and i will try\\n\\n      five minutes later three policemen had assembled in the hall\\n\\n      in the outhouse you will find a considerable quantity of straw\\n      said holmes i will ask you to carry in two bundles of it i\\n      think it will be of the greatest assistance in producing the\\n      witness whom i require thank you very much i believe you have\\n      some matches in your pocket watson now mr lestrade i will ask\\n      you all to accompany me to the top landing\\n\\n      as i have said there was a broad corridor there which ran\\n      outside three empty bedrooms at one end of the corridor we were\\n      all marshalled by sherlock holmes the constables grinning and\\n      lestrade staring at my friend with amazement expectation and\\n      derision chasing each other across his features holmes stood\\n      before us with the air of a conjurer who is performing a trick\\n\\n      would you kindly send one of your constables for two buckets of\\n      water put the straw on the floor here free from the wall on\\n      either side now i think that we are all ready\\n\\n      lestrades face had begun to grow red and angry i dont know\\n      whether you are playing a game with us mr sherlock holmes\\n      said he if you know anything you can surely say it without all\\n      this tomfoolery\\n\\n      i assure you my good lestrade that i have an excellent reason\\n      for everything that i do you may possibly remember that you\\n      chaffed me a little some hours ago when the sun seemed on your\\n      side of the hedge so you must not grudge me a little pomp and\\n      ceremony now might i ask you watson to open that window and\\n      then to put a match to the edge of the straw\\n\\n      i did so and driven by the draught a coil of grey smoke swirled\\n      down the corridor while the dry straw crackled and flamed\\n\\n      now we must see if we can find this witness for you lestrade\\n      might i ask you all to join in the cry of fire now then one\\n      two three\\n\\n      fire we all yelled\\n\\n      thank you i will trouble you once again\\n\\n      fire\\n\\n      just once more gentlemen and all together\\n\\n      fire the shout must have rung over norwood\\n\\n      it had hardly died away when an amazing thing happened a door\\n      suddenly flew open out of what appeared to be solid wall at the\\n      end of the corridor and a little wizened man darted out of it\\n      like a rabbit out of its burrow\\n\\n      capital said holmes calmly watson a bucket of water over\\n      the straw that will do lestrade allow me to present you with\\n      your principal missing witness mr jonas oldacre\\n\\n      the detective stared at the newcomer with blank amazement the\\n      latter was blinking in the bright light of the corridor and\\n      peering at us and at the smouldering fire it was an odious\\n      facecrafty vicious malignant with shifty lightgrey eyes and\\n      white lashes\\n\\n      whats this then said lestrade at last what have you been\\n      doing all this time eh\\n\\n      oldacre gave an uneasy laugh shrinking back from the furious red\\n      face of the angry detective\\n\\n      i have done no harm\\n\\n      no harm you have done your best to get an innocent man hanged\\n      if it wasnt for this gentleman here i am not sure that you\\n      would not have succeeded\\n\\n      the wretched creature began to whimper\\n\\n      i am sure sir it was only my practical joke\\n\\n      oh a joke was it you wont find the laugh on your side i\\n      promise you take him down and keep him in the sittingroom\\n      until i come mr holmes he continued when they had gone i\\n      could not speak before the constables but i dont mind saying\\n      in the presence of dr watson that this is the brightest thing\\n      that you have done yet though it is a mystery to me how you did\\n      it you have saved an innocent mans life and you have prevented\\n      a very grave scandal which would have ruined my reputation in\\n      the force\\n\\n      holmes smiled and clapped lestrade upon the shoulder\\n\\n      instead of being ruined my good sir you will find that your\\n      reputation has been enormously enhanced just make a few\\n      alterations in that report which you were writing and they will\\n      understand how hard it is to throw dust in the eyes of inspector\\n      lestrade\\n\\n      and you dont want your name to appear\\n\\n      not at all the work is its own reward perhaps i shall get the\\n      credit also at some distant day when i permit my zealous\\n      historian to lay out his foolscap once moreeh watson well\\n      now let us see where this rat has been lurking\\n\\n      a lathandplaster partition had been run across the passage six\\n      feet from the end with a door cunningly concealed in it it was\\n      lit within by slits under the eaves a few articles of furniture\\n      and a supply of food and water were within together with a\\n      number of books and papers\\n\\n      theres the advantage of being a builder said holmes as we\\n      came out he was able to fix up his own little hidingplace\\n      without any confederatesave of course that precious\\n      housekeeper of his whom i should lose no time in adding to your\\n      bag lestrade\\n\\n      ill take your advice but how did you know of this place mr\\n      holmes\\n\\n      i made up my mind that the fellow was in hiding in the house\\n      when i paced one corridor and found it six feet shorter than the\\n      corresponding one below it was pretty clear where he was i\\n      thought he had not the nerve to lie quiet before an alarm of\\n      fire we could of course have gone in and taken him but it\\n      amused me to make him reveal himself besides i owed you a\\n      little mystification lestrade for your chaff in the morning\\n\\n      well sir you certainly got equal with me on that but how in\\n      the world did you know that he was in the house at all\\n\\n      the thumbmark lestrade you said it was final and so it was\\n      in a very different sense i knew it had not been there the day\\n      before i pay a good deal of attention to matters of detail as\\n      you may have observed and i had examined the hall and was sure\\n      that the wall was clear therefore it had been put on during the\\n      night\\n\\n      but how\\n\\n      very simply when those packets were sealed up jonas oldacre\\n      got mcfarlane to secure one of the seals by putting his thumb\\n      upon the soft wax it would be done so quickly and so naturally\\n      that i daresay the young man himself has no recollection of it\\n      very likely it just so happened and oldacre had himself no\\n      notion of the use he would put it to brooding over the case in\\n      that den of his it suddenly struck him what absolutely damning\\n      evidence he could make against mcfarlane by using that\\n      thumbmark it was the simplest thing in the world for him to\\n      take a wax impression from the seal to moisten it in as much\\n      blood as he could get from a pinprick and to put the mark upon\\n      the wall during the night either with his own hand or with that\\n      of his housekeeper if you examine among those documents which he\\n      took with him into his retreat i will lay you a wager that you\\n      find the seal with the thumbmark upon it\\n\\n      wonderful said lestrade wonderful its all as clear as\\n      crystal as you put it but what is the object of this deep\\n      deception mr holmes\\n\\n      it was amusing to me to see how the detectives overbearing\\n      manner had changed suddenly to that of a child asking questions\\n      of its teacher\\n\\n      well i dont think that is very hard to explain a very deep\\n      malicious vindictive person is the gentleman who is now waiting\\n      us downstairs you know that he was once refused by mcfarlanes\\n      mother you dont i told you that you should go to blackheath\\n      first and norwood afterwards well this injury as he would\\n      consider it has rankled in his wicked scheming brain and all\\n      his life he has longed for vengeance but never seen his chance\\n      during the last year or two things have gone against himsecret\\n      speculation i thinkand he finds himself in a bad way he\\n      determines to swindle his creditors and for this purpose he pays\\n      large checks to a certain mr cornelius who is i imagine\\n      himself under another name i have not traced these checks yet\\n      but i have no doubt that they were banked under that name at some\\n      provincial town where oldacre from time to time led a double\\n      existence he intended to change his name altogether draw this\\n      money and vanish starting life again elsewhere\\n\\n      well thats likely enough\\n\\n      it would strike him that in disappearing he might throw all\\n      pursuit off his track and at the same time have an ample and\\n      crushing revenge upon his old sweetheart if he could give the\\n      impression that he had been murdered by her only child it was a\\n      masterpiece of villainy and he carried it out like a master the\\n      idea of the will which would give an obvious motive for the\\n      crime the secret visit unknown to his own parents the retention\\n      of the stick the blood and the animal remains and buttons in\\n      the woodpile all were admirable it was a net from which it\\n      seemed to me a few hours ago that there was no possible escape\\n      but he had not that supreme gift of the artist the knowledge of\\n      when to stop he wished to improve that which was already\\n      perfectto draw the rope tighter yet round the neck of his\\n      unfortunate victimand so he ruined all let us descend\\n      lestrade there are just one or two questions that i would ask\\n      him\\n\\n      the malignant creature was seated in his own parlour with a\\n      policeman upon each side of him\\n\\n      it was a joke my good sira practical joke nothing more he\\n      whined incessantly i assure you sir that i simply concealed\\n      myself in order to see the effect of my disappearance and i am\\n      sure that you would not be so unjust as to imagine that i would\\n      have allowed any harm to befall poor young mr mcfarlane\\n\\n      thats for a jury to decide said lestrade anyhow we shall\\n      have you on a charge of conspiracy if not for attempted murder\\n\\n      and youll probably find that your creditors will impound the\\n      banking account of mr cornelius said holmes\\n\\n      the little man started and turned his malignant eyes upon my\\n      friend\\n\\n      i have to thank you for a good deal said he perhaps ill pay\\n      my debt some day\\n\\n      holmes smiled indulgently\\n\\n      i fancy that for some few years you will find your time very\\n      fully occupied said he by the way what was it you put into\\n      the woodpile besides your old trousers a dead dog or rabbits\\n      or what you wont tell dear me how very unkind of you well\\n      well i daresay that a couple of rabbits would account both for\\n      the blood and for the charred ashes if ever you write an\\n      account watson you can make rabbits serve your turn\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe adventure of the dancing men\\n\\n\\n      holmes had been seated for some hours in silence with his long\\n      thin back curved over a chemical vessel in which he was brewing a\\n      particularly malodorous product his head was sunk upon his\\n      breast and he looked from my point of view like a strange lank\\n      bird with dull grey plumage and a black topknot\\n\\n      so watson said he suddenly you do not propose to invest in\\n      south african securities\\n\\n      i gave a start of astonishment accustomed as i was to holmess\\n      curious faculties this sudden intrusion into my most intimate\\n      thoughts was utterly inexplicable\\n\\n      how on earth do you know that i asked\\n\\n      he wheeled round upon his stool with a steaming testtube in his\\n      hand and a gleam of amusement in his deepset eyes\\n\\n      now watson confess yourself utterly taken aback said he\\n\\n      i am\\n\\n      i ought to make you sign a paper to that effect\\n\\n      why\\n\\n      because in five minutes you will say that it is all so absurdly\\n      simple\\n\\n      i am sure that i shall say nothing of the kind\\n\\n      you see my dear watsonhe propped his testtube in the rack\\n      and began to lecture with the air of a professor addressing his\\n      classit is not really difficult to construct a series of\\n      inferences each dependent upon its predecessor and each simple\\n      in itself if after doing so one simply knocks out all the\\n      central inferences and presents ones audience with the\\n      startingpoint and the conclusion one may produce a startling\\n      though possibly a meretricious effect now it was not really\\n      difficult by an inspection of the groove between your left\\n      forefinger and thumb to feel sure that you did not propose to\\n      invest your small capital in the gold fields\\n\\n      i see no connection\\n\\n      very likely not but i can quickly show you a close connection\\n      here are the missing links of the very simple chain  you had\\n      chalk between your left finger and thumb when you returned from\\n      the club last night  you put chalk there when you play\\n      billiards to steady the cue  you never play billiards except\\n      with thurston  you told me four weeks ago that thurston had\\n      an option on some south african property which would expire in a\\n      month and which he desired you to share with him  your check\\n      book is locked in my drawer and you have not asked for the key\\n       you do not propose to invest your money in this manner\\n\\n      how absurdly simple i cried\\n\\n      quite so said he a little nettled every problem becomes\\n      very childish when once it is explained to you here is an\\n      unexplained one see what you can make of that friend watson\\n      he tossed a sheet of paper upon the table and turned once more\\n      to his chemical analysis\\n\\n      i looked with amazement at the absurd hieroglyphics upon the\\n      paper\\n\\n      why holmes it is a childs drawing i cried\\n\\n      oh thats your idea\\n\\n      what else should it be\\n\\n      that is what mr hilton cubitt of riding thorpe manor norfolk\\n      is very anxious to know this little conundrum came by the first\\n      post and he was to follow by the next train theres a ring at\\n      the bell watson i should not be very much surprised if this\\n      were he\\n\\n      a heavy step was heard upon the stairs and an instant later\\n      there entered a tall ruddy cleanshaven gentleman whose clear\\n      eyes and florid cheeks told of a life led far from the fogs of\\n      baker street he seemed to bring a whiff of his strong fresh\\n      bracing eastcoast air with him as he entered having shaken\\n      hands with each of us he was about to sit down when his eye\\n      rested upon the paper with the curious markings which i had just\\n      examined and left upon the table\\n\\n      well mr holmes what do you make of these he cried they\\n      told me that you were fond of queer mysteries and i dont think\\n      you can find a queerer one than that i sent the paper on ahead\\n      so that you might have time to study it before i came\\n\\n      it is certainly rather a curious production said holmes at\\n      first sight it would appear to be some childish prank it\\n      consists of a number of absurd little figures dancing across the\\n      paper upon which they are drawn why should you attribute any\\n      importance to so grotesque an object\\n\\n      i never should mr holmes but my wife does it is frightening\\n      her to death she says nothing but i can see terror in her eyes\\n      thats why i want to sift the matter to the bottom\\n\\n      holmes held up the paper so that the sunlight shone full upon it\\n      it was a page torn from a notebook the markings were done in\\n      pencil and ran in this way\\n\\n      amhereabeslaney\\n\\n      holmes examined it for some time and then folding it carefully\\n      up he placed it in his pocketbook\\n\\n      this promises to be a most interesting and unusual case said\\n      he you gave me a few particulars in your letter mr hilton\\n      cubitt but i should be very much obliged if you would kindly go\\n      over it all again for the benefit of my friend dr watson\\n\\n      im not much of a storyteller said our visitor nervously\\n      clasping and unclasping his great strong hands youll just ask\\n      me anything that i dont make clear ill begin at the time of my\\n      marriage last year but i want to say first of all that though\\n      im not a rich man my people have been at riding thorpe for a\\n      matter of five centuries and there is no better known family in\\n      the county of norfolk last year i came up to london for the\\n      jubilee and i stopped at a boardinghouse in russell square\\n      because parker the vicar of our parish was staying in it there\\n      was an american young lady therepatrick was the nameelsie\\n      patrick in some way we became friends until before my month was\\n      up i was as much in love as a man could be we were quietly\\n      married at a registry office and we returned to norfolk a wedded\\n      couple youll think it very mad mr holmes that a man of a\\n      good old family should marry a wife in this fashion knowing\\n      nothing of her past or of her people but if you saw her and knew\\n      her it would help you to understand\\n\\n      she was very straight about it was elsie i cant say that she\\n      did not give me every chance of getting out of it if i wished to\\n      do so i have had some very disagreeable associations in my\\n      life said she i wish to forget all about them i would rather\\n      never allude to the past for it is very painful to me if you\\n      take me hilton you will take a woman who has nothing that she\\n      need be personally ashamed of but you will have to be content\\n      with my word for it and to allow me to be silent as to all that\\n      passed up to the time when i became yours if these conditions\\n      are too hard then go back to norfolk and leave me to the lonely\\n      life in which you found me it was only the day before our\\n      wedding that she said those very words to me i told her that i\\n      was content to take her on her own terms and i have been as good\\n      as my word\\n\\n      well we have been married now for a year and very happy we have\\n      been but about a month ago at the end of june i saw for the\\n      first time signs of trouble one day my wife received a letter\\n      from america i saw the american stamp she turned deadly white\\n      read the letter and threw it into the fire she made no allusion\\n      to it afterwards and i made none for a promise is a promise\\n      but she has never known an easy hour from that moment there is\\n      always a look of fear upon her facea look as if she were waiting\\n      and expecting she would do better to trust me she would find\\n      that i was her best friend but until she speaks i can say\\n      nothing mind you she is a truthful woman mr holmes and\\n      whatever trouble there may have been in her past life it has been\\n      no fault of hers i am only a simple norfolk squire but there is\\n      not a man in england who ranks his family honour more highly than\\n      i do she knows it well and she knew it well before she married\\n      me she would never bring any stain upon itof that i am sure\\n\\n      well now i come to the queer part of my story about a week\\n      agoit was the tuesday of last weeki found on one of the\\n      windowsills a number of absurd little dancing figures like these\\n      upon the paper they were scrawled with chalk i thought that it\\n      was the stableboy who had drawn them but the lad swore he knew\\n      nothing about it anyhow they had come there during the night i\\n      had them washed out and i only mentioned the matter to my wife\\n      afterwards to my surprise she took it very seriously and\\n      begged me if any more came to let her see them none did come for\\n      a week and then yesterday morning i found this paper lying on\\n      the sundial in the garden i showed it to elsie and down she\\n      dropped in a dead faint since then she has looked like a woman\\n      in a dream half dazed and with terror always lurking in her\\n      eyes it was then that i wrote and sent the paper to you mr\\n      holmes it was not a thing that i could take to the police for\\n      they would have laughed at me but you will tell me what to do i\\n      am not a rich man but if there is any danger threatening my\\n      little woman i would spend my last copper to shield her\\n\\n      he was a fine creature this man of the old english soilsimple\\n      straight and gentle with his great earnest blue eyes and\\n      broad comely face his love for his wife and his trust in her\\n      shone in his features holmes had listened to his story with the\\n      utmost attention and now he sat for some time in silent thought\\n\\n      dont you think mr cubitt said he at last that your best\\n      plan would be to make a direct appeal to your wife and to ask\\n      her to share her secret with you\\n\\n      hilton cubitt shook his massive head\\n\\n      a promise is a promise mr holmes if elsie wished to tell me\\n      she would if not it is not for me to force her confidence but\\n      i am justified in taking my own lineand i will\\n\\n      then i will help you with all my heart in the first place have\\n      you heard of any strangers being seen in your neighbourhood\\n\\n      no\\n\\n      i presume that it is a very quiet place any fresh face would\\n      cause comment\\n\\n      in the immediate neighbourhood yes but we have several small\\n      wateringplaces not very far away and the farmers take in\\n      lodgers\\n\\n      these hieroglyphics have evidently a meaning if it is a purely\\n      arbitrary one it may be impossible for us to solve it if on\\n      the other hand it is systematic i have no doubt that we shall\\n      get to the bottom of it but this particular sample is so short\\n      that i can do nothing and the facts which you have brought me\\n      are so indefinite that we have no basis for an investigation i\\n      would suggest that you return to norfolk that you keep a keen\\n      lookout and that you take an exact copy of any fresh dancing men\\n      which may appear it is a thousand pities that we have not a\\n      reproduction of those which were done in chalk upon the\\n      windowsill make a discreet inquiry also as to any strangers in\\n      the neighbourhood when you have collected some fresh evidence\\n      come to me again that is the best advice which i can give you\\n      mr hilton cubitt if there are any pressing fresh developments\\n      i shall be always ready to run down and see you in your norfolk\\n      home\\n\\n      the interview left sherlock holmes very thoughtful and several\\n      times in the next few days i saw him take his slip of paper from\\n      his notebook and look long and earnestly at the curious figures\\n      inscribed upon it he made no allusion to the affair however\\n      until one afternoon a fortnight or so later i was going out when\\n      he called me back\\n\\n      you had better stay here watson\\n\\n      why\\n\\n      because i had a wire from hilton cubitt this morning you\\n      remember hilton cubitt of the dancing men he was to reach\\n      liverpool street at onetwenty he may be here at any moment i\\n      gather from his wire that there have been some new incidents of\\n      importance\\n\\n      we had not long to wait for our norfolk squire came straight\\n      from the station as fast as a hansom could bring him he was\\n      looking worried and depressed with tired eyes and a lined\\n      forehead\\n\\n      its getting on my nerves this business mr holmes said he\\n      as he sank like a wearied man into an armchair its bad\\n      enough to feel that you are surrounded by unseen unknown folk\\n      who have some kind of design upon you but when in addition to\\n      that you know that it is just killing your wife by inches then\\n      it becomes as much as flesh and blood can endure shes wearing\\n      away under itjust wearing away before my eyes\\n\\n      has she said anything yet\\n\\n      no mr holmes she has not and yet there have been times when\\n      the poor girl has wanted to speak and yet could not quite bring\\n      herself to take the plunge i have tried to help her but i\\n      daresay i did it clumsily and scared her from it she has spoken\\n      about my old family and our reputation in the county and our\\n      pride in our unsullied honour and i always felt it was leading\\n      to the point but somehow it turned off before we got there\\n\\n      but you have found out something for yourself\\n\\n      a good deal mr holmes i have several fresh dancingmen\\n      pictures for you to examine and what is more important i have\\n      seen the fellow\\n\\n      what the man who draws them\\n\\n      yes i saw him at his work but i will tell you everything in\\n      order when i got back after my visit to you the very first\\n      thing i saw next morning was a fresh crop of dancing men they\\n      had been drawn in chalk upon the black wooden door of the\\n      toolhouse which stands beside the lawn in full view of the\\n      front windows i took an exact copy and here it is he unfolded\\n      a paper and laid it upon the table here is a copy of the\\n      hieroglyphics\\n\\n      atelriges\\n\\n      excellent said holmes excellent pray continue\\n\\n      when i had taken the copy i rubbed out the marks but two\\n      mornings later a fresh inscription had appeared i have a copy\\n      of it here\\n\\n      comeelsie\\n\\n      holmes rubbed his hands and chuckled with delight\\n\\n      our material is rapidly accumulating said he\\n\\n      three days later a message was left scrawled upon paper and\\n      placed under a pebble upon the sundial here it is the\\n      characters are as you see exactly the same as the last one\\n      after that i determined to lie in wait so i got out my revolver\\n      and i sat up in my study which overlooks the lawn and garden\\n      about two in the morning i was seated by the window all being\\n      dark save for the moonlight outside when i heard steps behind\\n      me and there was my wife in her dressinggown she implored me\\n      to come to bed i told her frankly that i wished to see who it\\n      was who played such absurd tricks upon us she answered that it\\n      was some senseless practical joke and that i should not take any\\n      notice of it\\n\\n      if it really annoys you hilton we might go and travel you\\n      and i and so avoid this nuisance\\n\\n      what be driven out of our own house by a practical joker\\n      said i why we should have the whole county laughing at us\\n\\n      well come to bed said she and we can discuss it in the\\n      morning\\n\\n      suddenly as she spoke i saw her white face grow whiter yet in\\n      the moonlight and her hand tightened upon my shoulder something\\n      was moving in the shadow of the toolhouse i saw a dark\\n      creeping figure which crawled round the corner and squatted in\\n      front of the door seizing my pistol i was rushing out when my\\n      wife threw her arms round me and held me with convulsive\\n      strength i tried to throw her off but she clung to me most\\n      desperately at last i got clear but by the time i had opened\\n      the door and reached the house the creature was gone he had left\\n      a trace of his presence however for there on the door was the\\n      very same arrangement of dancing men which had already twice\\n      appeared and which i have copied on that paper there was no\\n      other sign of the fellow anywhere though i ran all over the\\n      grounds and yet the amazing thing is that he must have been\\n      there all the time for when i examined the door again in the\\n      morning he had scrawled some more of his pictures under the line\\n      which i had already seen\\n\\n      have you that fresh drawing\\n\\n      yes it is very short but i made a copy of it and here it is\\n\\n      again he produced a paper the new dance was in this form\\n\\n      never\\n\\n      tell me said holmesand i could see by his eyes that he was\\n      much excitedwas this a mere addition to the first or did it\\n      appear to be entirely separate\\n\\n      it was on a different panel of the door\\n\\n      excellent this is far the most important of all for our\\n      purpose it fills me with hopes now mr hilton cubitt please\\n      continue your most interesting statement\\n\\n      i have nothing more to say mr holmes except that i was angry\\n      with my wife that night for having held me back when i might have\\n      caught the skulking rascal she said that she feared that i might\\n      come to harm for an instant it had crossed my mind that perhaps\\n      what she really feared was that he might come to harm for i\\n      could not doubt that she knew who this man was and what he meant\\n      by these strange signals but there is a tone in my wifes voice\\n      mr holmes and a look in her eyes which forbid doubt and i am\\n      sure that it was indeed my own safety that was in her mind\\n      theres the whole case and now i want your advice as to what i\\n      ought to do my own inclination is to put half a dozen of my farm\\n      lads in the shrubbery and when this fellow comes again to give\\n      him such a hiding that he will leave us in peace for the future\\n\\n      i fear it is too deep a case for such simple remedies said\\n      holmes how long can you stay in london\\n\\n      i must go back today i would not leave my wife alone all night\\n      for anything she is very nervous and begged me to come back\\n\\n      i daresay you are right but if you could have stopped i might\\n      possibly have been able to return with you in a day or two\\n      meanwhile you will leave me these papers and i think that it is\\n      very likely that i shall be able to pay you a visit shortly and\\n      to throw some light upon your case\\n\\n      sherlock holmes preserved his calm professional manner until our\\n      visitor had left us although it was easy for me who knew him so\\n      well to see that he was profoundly excited the moment that\\n      hilton cubitts broad back had disappeared through the door my\\n      comrade rushed to the table laid out all the slips of paper\\n      containing dancing men in front of him and threw himself into an\\n      intricate and elaborate calculation for two hours i watched him\\n      as he covered sheet after sheet of paper with figures and\\n      letters so completely absorbed in his task that he had evidently\\n      forgotten my presence sometimes he was making progress and\\n      whistled and sang at his work sometimes he was puzzled and\\n      would sit for long spells with a furrowed brow and a vacant eye\\n      finally he sprang from his chair with a cry of satisfaction and\\n      walked up and down the room rubbing his hands together then he\\n      wrote a long telegram upon a cable form if my answer to this is\\n      as i hope you will have a very pretty case to add to your\\n      collection watson said he i expect that we shall be able to\\n      go down to norfolk tomorrow and to take our friend some very\\n      definite news as to the secret of his annoyance\\n\\n      i confess that i was filled with curiosity but i was aware that\\n      holmes liked to make his disclosures at his own time and in his\\n      own way so i waited until it should suit him to take me into his\\n      confidence\\n\\n      but there was a delay in that answering telegram and two days of\\n      impatience followed during which holmes pricked up his ears at\\n      every ring of the bell on the evening of the second there came a\\n      letter from hilton cubitt all was quiet with him save that a\\n      long inscription had appeared that morning upon the pedestal of\\n      the sundial he inclosed a copy of it which is here reproduced\\n\\n      elsiepreparetomeetthygod\\n\\n      holmes bent over this grotesque frieze for some minutes and then\\n      suddenly sprang to his feet with an exclamation of surprise and\\n      dismay his face was haggard with anxiety\\n\\n      we have let this affair go far enough said he is there a\\n      train to north walsham tonight\\n\\n      i turned up the timetable the last had just gone\\n\\n      then we shall breakfast early and take the very first in the\\n      morning said holmes our presence is most urgently needed ah\\n      here is our expected cablegram one moment mrs hudson there\\n      may be an answer no that is quite as i expected this message\\n      makes it even more essential that we should not lose an hour in\\n      letting hilton cubitt know how matters stand for it is a\\n      singular and a dangerous web in which our simple norfolk squire\\n      is entangled\\n\\n      so indeed it proved and as i come to the dark conclusion of a\\n      story which had seemed to me to be only childish and bizarre i\\n      experience once again the dismay and horror with which i was\\n      filled would that i had some brighter ending to communicate to\\n      my readers but these are the chronicles of fact and i must\\n      follow to their dark crisis the strange chain of events which for\\n      some days made riding thorpe manor a household word through the\\n      length and breadth of england\\n\\n      we had hardly alighted at north walsham and mentioned the name\\n      of our destination when the stationmaster hurried towards us\\n      i suppose that you are the detectives from london said he\\n\\n      a look of annoyance passed over holmess face\\n\\n      what makes you think such a thing\\n\\n      because inspector martin from norwich has just passed through\\n      but maybe you are the surgeons shes not deador wasnt by last\\n      accounts you may be in time to save her yetthough it be for the\\n      gallows\\n\\n      holmess brow was dark with anxiety\\n\\n      we are going to riding thorpe manor said he but we have\\n      heard nothing of what has passed there\\n\\n      its a terrible business said the stationmaster they are\\n      shot both mr hilton cubitt and his wife she shot him and then\\n      herselfso the servants say hes dead and her life is despaired\\n      of dear dear one of the oldest families in the county of\\n      norfolk and one of the most honoured\\n\\n      without a word holmes hurried to a carriage and during the long\\n      seven miles drive he never opened his mouth seldom have i seen\\n      him so utterly despondent he had been uneasy during all our\\n      journey from town and i had observed that he had turned over the\\n      morning papers with anxious attention but now this sudden\\n      realization of his worst fears left him in a blank melancholy he\\n      leaned back in his seat lost in gloomy speculation yet there\\n      was much around to interest us for we were passing through as\\n      singular a countryside as any in england where a few scattered\\n      cottages represented the population of today while on every\\n      hand enormous squaretowered churches bristled up from the flat\\n      green landscape and told of the glory and prosperity of old east\\n      anglia at last the violet rim of the german ocean appeared over\\n      the green edge of the norfolk coast and the driver pointed with\\n      his whip to two old brick and timber gables which projected from\\n      a grove of trees thats riding thorpe manor said he\\n\\n      as we drove up to the porticoed front door i observed in front\\n      of it beside the tennis lawn the black toolhouse and the\\n      pedestalled sundial with which we had such strange associations\\n      a dapper little man with a quick alert manner and a waxed\\n      moustache had just descended from a high dogcart he introduced\\n      himself as inspector martin of the norfolk constabulary and he\\n      was considerably astonished when he heard the name of my\\n      companion\\n\\n      why mr holmes the crime was only committed at three this\\n      morning how could you hear of it in london and get to the spot\\n      as soon as i\\n\\n      i anticipated it i came in the hope of preventing it\\n\\n      then you must have important evidence of which we are ignorant\\n      for they were said to be a most united couple\\n\\n      i have only the evidence of the dancing men said holmes i\\n      will explain the matter to you later meanwhile since it is too\\n      late to prevent this tragedy i am very anxious that i should use\\n      the knowledge which i possess in order to insure that justice be\\n      done will you associate me in your investigation or will you\\n      prefer that i should act independently\\n\\n      i should be proud to feel that we were acting together mr\\n      holmes said the inspector earnestly\\n\\n      in that case i should be glad to hear the evidence and to\\n      examine the premises without an instant of unnecessary delay\\n\\n      inspector martin had the good sense to allow my friend to do\\n      things in his own fashion and contented himself with carefully\\n      noting the results the local surgeon an old whitehaired man\\n      had just come down from mrs hilton cubitts room and he\\n      reported that her injuries were serious but not necessarily\\n      fatal the bullet had passed through the front of her brain and\\n      it would probably be some time before she could regain\\n      consciousness on the question of whether she had been shot or\\n      had shot herself he would not venture to express any decided\\n      opinion certainly the bullet had been discharged at very close\\n      quarters there was only the one pistol found in the room two\\n      barrels of which had been emptied mr hilton cubitt had been\\n      shot through the heart it was equally conceivable that he had\\n      shot her and then himself or that she had been the criminal for\\n      the revolver lay upon the floor midway between them\\n\\n      has he been moved asked holmes\\n\\n      we have moved nothing except the lady we could not leave her\\n      lying wounded upon the floor\\n\\n      how long have you been here doctor\\n\\n      since four oclock\\n\\n      anyone else\\n\\n      yes the constable here\\n\\n      and you have touched nothing\\n\\n      nothing\\n\\n      you have acted with great discretion who sent for you\\n\\n      the housemaid saunders\\n\\n      was it she who gave the alarm\\n\\n      she and mrs king the cook\\n\\n      where are they now\\n\\n      in the kitchen i believe\\n\\n      then i think we had better hear their story at once\\n\\n      the old hall oakpanelled and highwindowed had been turned\\n      into a court of investigation holmes sat in a great\\n      oldfashioned chair his inexorable eyes gleaming out of his\\n      haggard face i could read in them a set purpose to devote his\\n      life to this quest until the client whom he had failed to save\\n      should at last be avenged the trim inspector martin the old\\n      greyheaded country doctor myself and a stolid village\\n      policeman made up the rest of that strange company\\n\\n      the two women told their story clearly enough they had been\\n      aroused from their sleep by the sound of an explosion which had\\n      been followed a minute later by a second one they slept in\\n      adjoining rooms and mrs king had rushed in to saunders\\n      together they had descended the stairs the door of the study was\\n      open and a candle was burning upon the table their master lay\\n      upon his face in the centre of the room he was quite dead near\\n      the window his wife was crouching her head leaning against the\\n      wall she was horribly wounded and the side of her face was red\\n      with blood she breathed heavily but was incapable of saying\\n      anything the passage as well as the room was full of smoke and\\n      the smell of powder the window was certainly shut and fastened\\n      upon the inside both women were positive upon the point they\\n      had at once sent for the doctor and for the constable then with\\n      the aid of the groom and the stableboy they had conveyed their\\n      injured mistress to her room both she and her husband had\\n      occupied the bed she was clad in her dresshe in his\\n      dressinggown over his nightclothes nothing had been moved in\\n      the study so far as they knew there had never been any quarrel\\n      between husband and wife they had always looked upon them as a\\n      very united couple\\n\\n      these were the main points of the servants evidence in answer\\n      to inspector martin they were clear that every door was fastened\\n      upon the inside and that no one could have escaped from the\\n      house in answer to holmes they both remembered that they were\\n      conscious of the smell of powder from the moment that they ran\\n      out of their rooms upon the top floor i commend that fact very\\n      carefully to your attention said holmes to his professional\\n      colleague and now i think that we are in a position to\\n      undertake a thorough examination of the room\\n\\n      the study proved to be a small chamber lined on three sides with\\n      books and with a writingtable facing an ordinary window which\\n      looked out upon the garden our first attention was given to the\\n      body of the unfortunate squire whose huge frame lay stretched\\n      across the room his disordered dress showed that he had been\\n      hastily aroused from sleep the bullet had been fired at him from\\n      the front and had remained in his body after penetrating the\\n      heart his death had certainly been instantaneous and painless\\n      there was no powdermarking either upon his dressinggown or on\\n      his hands according to the country surgeon the lady had stains\\n      upon her face but none upon her hand\\n\\n      the absence of the latter means nothing though its presence may\\n      mean everything said holmes unless the powder from a badly\\n      fitting cartridge happens to spurt backward one may fire many\\n      shots without leaving a sign i would suggest that mr cubitts\\n      body may now be removed i suppose doctor you have not\\n      recovered the bullet which wounded the lady\\n\\n      a serious operation will be necessary before that can be done\\n      but there are still four cartridges in the revolver two have\\n      been fired and two wounds inflicted so that each bullet can be\\n      accounted for\\n\\n      so it would seem said holmes perhaps you can account also\\n      for the bullet which has so obviously struck the edge of the\\n      window\\n\\n      he had turned suddenly and his long thin finger was pointing to\\n      a hole which had been drilled right through the lower\\n      windowsash about an inch above the bottom\\n\\n      by george cried the inspector how ever did you see that\\n\\n      because i looked for it\\n\\n      wonderful said the country doctor you are certainly right\\n      sir then a third shot has been fired and therefore a third\\n      person must have been present but who could that have been and\\n      how could he have got away\\n\\n      that is the problem which we are now about to solve said\\n      sherlock holmes you remember inspector martin when the\\n      servants said that on leaving their room they were at once\\n      conscious of a smell of powder i remarked that the point was an\\n      extremely important one\\n\\n      yes sir but i confess i did not quite follow you\\n\\n      it suggested that at the time of the firing the window as well\\n      as the door of the room had been open otherwise the fumes of\\n      powder could not have been blown so rapidly through the house a\\n      draught in the room was necessary for that both door and window\\n      were only open for a very short time however\\n\\n      how do you prove that\\n\\n      because the candle was not guttered\\n\\n      capital cried the inspector capital\\n\\n      feeling sure that the window had been open at the time of the\\n      tragedy i conceived that there might have been a third person in\\n      the affair who stood outside this opening and fired through it\\n      any shot directed at this person might hit the sash i looked\\n      and there sure enough was the bullet mark\\n\\n      but how came the window to be shut and fastened\\n\\n      the womans first instinct would be to shut and fasten the\\n      window but halloa what is this\\n\\n      it was a ladys handbag which stood upon the study tablea trim\\n      little handbag of crocodileskin and silver holmes opened it and\\n      turned the contents out there were twenty fiftypound notes of\\n      the bank of england held together by an indiarubber\\n      bandnothing else\\n\\n      this must be preserved for it will figure in the trial said\\n      holmes as he handed the bag with its contents to the inspector\\n      it is now necessary that we should try to throw some light upon\\n      this third bullet which has clearly from the splintering of the\\n      wood been fired from inside the room i should like to see mrs\\n      king the cook again you said mrs king that you were\\n      awakened by a loud explosion when you said that did you mean\\n      that it seemed to you to be louder than the second one\\n\\n      well sir it wakened me from my sleep so it is hard to judge\\n      but it did seem very loud\\n\\n      you dont think that it might have been two shots fired almost\\n      at the same instant\\n\\n      i am sure i couldnt say sir\\n\\n      i believe that it was undoubtedly so i rather think inspector\\n      martin that we have now exhausted all that this room can teach\\n      us if you will kindly step round with me we shall see what\\n      fresh evidence the garden has to offer\\n\\n      a flowerbed extended up to the study window and we all broke\\n      into an exclamation as we approached it the flowers were\\n      trampled down and the soft soil was imprinted all over with\\n      footmarks large masculine feet they were with peculiarly long\\n      sharp toes holmes hunted about among the grass and leaves like a\\n      retriever after a wounded bird then with a cry of satisfaction\\n      he bent forward and picked up a little brazen cylinder\\n\\n      i thought so said he the revolver had an ejector and here\\n      is the third cartridge i really think inspector martin that\\n      our case is almost complete\\n\\n      the country inspectors face had shown his intense amazement at\\n      the rapid and masterful progress of holmess investigation at\\n      first he had shown some disposition to assert his own position\\n      but now he was overcome with admiration and ready to follow\\n      without question wherever holmes led\\n\\n      whom do you suspect he asked\\n\\n      ill go into that later there are several points in this\\n      problem which i have not been able to explain to you yet now\\n      that i have got so far i had best proceed on my own lines and\\n      then clear the whole matter up once and for all\\n\\n      just as you wish mr holmes so long as we get our man\\n\\n      i have no desire to make mysteries but it is impossible at the\\n      moment of action to enter into long and complex explanations i\\n      have the threads of this affair all in my hand even if this lady\\n      should never recover consciousness we can still reconstruct the\\n      events of last night and insure that justice be done first of\\n      all i wish to know whether there is any inn in this\\n      neighbourhood known as elriges\\n\\n      the servants were crossquestioned but none of them had heard of\\n      such a place the stableboy threw a light upon the matter by\\n      remembering that a farmer of that name lived some miles off in\\n      the direction of east ruston\\n\\n      is it a lonely farm\\n\\n      very lonely sir\\n\\n      perhaps they have not heard yet of all that happened here during\\n      the night\\n\\n      maybe not sir\\n\\n      holmes thought for a little and then a curious smile played over\\n      his face\\n\\n      saddle a horse my lad said he i shall wish you to take a\\n      note to elriges farm\\n\\n      he took from his pocket the various slips of the dancing men\\n      with these in front of him he worked for some time at the\\n      studytable finally he handed a note to the boy with directions\\n      to put it into the hands of the person to whom it was addressed\\n      and especially to answer no questions of any sort which might be\\n      put to him i saw the outside of the note addressed in\\n      straggling irregular characters very unlike holmess usual\\n      precise hand it was consigned to mr abe slaney elriges farm\\n      east ruston norfolk\\n\\n      i think inspector holmes remarked that you would do well to\\n      telegraph for an escort as if my calculations prove to be\\n      correct you may have a particularly dangerous prisoner to convey\\n      to the county jail the boy who takes this note could no doubt\\n      forward your telegram if there is an afternoon train to town\\n      watson i think we should do well to take it as i have a\\n      chemical analysis of some interest to finish and this\\n      investigation draws rapidly to a close\\n\\n      when the youth had been dispatched with the note sherlock holmes\\n      gave his instructions to the servants if any visitor were to\\n      call asking for mrs hilton cubitt no information should be\\n      given as to her condition but he was to be shown at once into\\n      the drawingroom he impressed these points upon them with the\\n      utmost earnestness finally he led the way into the drawingroom\\n      with the remark that the business was now out of our hands and\\n      that we must while away the time as best we might until we could\\n      see what was in store for us the doctor had departed to his\\n      patients and only the inspector and myself remained\\n\\n      i think that i can help you to pass an hour in an interesting\\n      and profitable manner said holmes drawing his chair up to the\\n      table and spreading out in front of him the various papers upon\\n      which were recorded the antics of the dancing men as to you\\n      friend watson i owe you every atonement for having allowed your\\n      natural curiosity to remain so long unsatisfied to you\\n      inspector the whole incident may appeal as a remarkable\\n      professional study i must tell you first of all the\\n      interesting circumstances connected with the previous\\n      consultations which mr hilton cubitt has had with me in baker\\n      street he then shortly recapitulated the facts which have\\n      already been recorded i have here in front of me these singular\\n      productions at which one might smile had they not proved\\n      themselves to be the forerunners of so terrible a tragedy i am\\n      fairly familiar with all forms of secret writings and am myself\\n      the author of a trifling monograph upon the subject in which i\\n      analyze one hundred and sixty separate ciphers but i confess\\n      that this is entirely new to me the object of those who invented\\n      the system has apparently been to conceal that these characters\\n      convey a message and to give the idea that they are the mere\\n      random sketches of children\\n\\n      having once recognized however that the symbols stood for\\n      letters and having applied the rules which guide us in all forms\\n      of secret writings the solution was easy enough the first\\n      message submitted to me was so short that it was impossible for\\n      me to do more than to say with some confidence that the symbol\\n      xxx stood for e as you are aware e is the most common letter in\\n      the english alphabet and it predominates to so marked an extent\\n      that even in a short sentence one would expect to find it most\\n      often out of fifteen symbols in the first message four were the\\n      same so it was reasonable to set this down as e it is true that\\n      in some cases the figure was bearing a flag and in some cases\\n      not but it was probable from the way in which the flags were\\n      distributed that they were used to break the sentence up into\\n      words i accepted this as a hypothesis and noted that e was\\n      represented by\\n\\n      e\\n\\n      but now came the real difficulty of the inquiry the order of\\n      the english letters after e is by no means well marked and any\\n      preponderance which may be shown in an average of a printed sheet\\n      may be reversed in a single short sentence speaking roughly t\\n      a o i n s h r d and l are the numerical order in which\\n      letters occur but t a o and i are very nearly abreast of each\\n      other and it would be an endless task to try each combination\\n      until a meaning was arrived at i therefore waited for fresh\\n      material in my second interview with mr hilton cubitt he was\\n      able to give me two other short sentences and one message which\\n      appearedsince there was no flagto be a single word here are\\n      the symbols now in the single word i have already got the two\\n      es coming second and fourth in a word of five letters it might\\n      be sever or lever or never there can be no question that\\n      the latter as a reply to an appeal is far the most probable and\\n      the circumstances pointed to its being a reply written by the\\n      lady accepting it as correct we are now able to say that the\\n      symbols stand respectively for n v and r\\n\\n      nvr\\n\\n      even now i was in considerable difficulty but a happy thought\\n      put me in possession of several other letters it occurred to me\\n      that if these appeals came as i expected from someone who had\\n      been intimate with the lady in her early life a combination\\n      which contained two es with three letters between might very\\n      well stand for the name elsie on examination i found that such\\n      a combination formed the termination of the message which was\\n      three times repeated it was certainly some appeal to elsie in\\n      this way i had got my l s and i but what appeal could it be\\n      there were only four letters in the word which preceded elsie\\n      and it ended in e surely the word must be come i tried all\\n      other four letters ending in e but could find none to fit the\\n      case so now i was in possession of c o and m and i was in a\\n      position to attack the first message once more dividing it into\\n      words and putting dots for each symbol which was still unknown\\n      so treated it worked out in this fashion\\n\\n      m ere e slne\\n\\n      now the first letter can only be a which is a most useful\\n      discovery since it occurs no fewer than three times in this\\n      short sentence and the h is also apparent in the second word\\n      now it becomes\\n\\n      am here ae slane\\n\\n      or filling in the obvious vacancies in the name\\n\\n      am here abe slaney\\n\\n      i had so many letters now that i could proceed with considerable\\n      confidence to the second message which worked out in this\\n      fashion\\n\\n      a elri es\\n\\n      here i could only make sense by putting t and g for the missing\\n      letters and supposing that the name was that of some house or\\n      inn at which the writer was staying\\n\\n      inspector martin and i had listened with the utmost interest to\\n      the full and clear account of how my friend had produced results\\n      which had led to so complete a command over our difficulties\\n\\n      what did you do then sir asked the inspector\\n\\n      i had every reason to suppose that this abe slaney was an\\n      american since abe is an american contraction and since a\\n      letter from america had been the startingpoint of all the\\n      trouble i had also every cause to think that there was some\\n      criminal secret in the matter the ladys allusions to her past\\n      and her refusal to take her husband into her confidence both\\n      pointed in that direction i therefore cabled to my friend\\n      wilson hargreave of the new york police bureau who has more\\n      than once made use of my knowledge of london crime i asked him\\n      whether the name of abe slaney was known to him here is his\\n      reply the most dangerous crook in chicago on the very evening\\n      upon which i had his answer hilton cubitt sent me the last\\n      message from slaney working with known letters it took this\\n      form\\n\\n      elsie reare to meet thy go\\n\\n      the addition of a p and a d completed a message which showed me\\n      that the rascal was proceeding from persuasion to threats and my\\n      knowledge of the crooks of chicago prepared me to find that he\\n      might very rapidly put his words into action i at once came to\\n      norfolk with my friend and colleague dr watson but unhappily\\n      only in time to find that the worst had already occurred\\n\\n      it is a privilege to be associated with you in the handling of a\\n      case said the inspector warmly you will excuse me however\\n      if i speak frankly to you you are only answerable to yourself\\n      but i have to answer to my superiors if this abe slaney living\\n      at elriges is indeed the murderer and if he has made his\\n      escape while i am seated here i should certainly get into\\n      serious trouble\\n\\n      you need not be uneasy he will not try to escape\\n\\n      how do you know\\n\\n      to fly would be a confession of guilt\\n\\n      then let us go arrest him\\n\\n      i expect him here every instant\\n\\n      but why should he come\\n\\n      because i have written and asked him\\n\\n      but this is incredible mr holmes why should he come because\\n      you have asked him would not such a request rather rouse his\\n      suspicions and cause him to fly\\n\\n      i think i have known how to frame the letter said sherlock\\n      holmes in fact if i am not very much mistaken here is the\\n      gentleman himself coming up the drive\\n\\n      a man was striding up the path which led to the door he was a\\n      tall handsome swarthy fellow clad in a suit of grey flannel\\n      with a panama hat a bristling black beard and a great\\n      aggressive hooked nose and flourishing a cane as he walked he\\n      swaggered up a path as if the place belonged to him and we heard\\n      his loud confident peal at the bell\\n\\n      i think gentlemen said holmes quietly that we had best\\n      take up our position behind the door every precaution is\\n      necessary when dealing with such a fellow you will need your\\n      handcuffs inspector you can leave the talking to me\\n\\n      we waited in silence for a minuteone of those minutes which one\\n      can never forget then the door opened and the man stepped in in\\n      an instant holmes clapped a pistol to his head and martin\\n      slipped the handcuffs over his wrists it was all done so swiftly\\n      and deftly that the fellow was helpless before he knew that he\\n      was attacked he glared from one to the other of us with a pair\\n      of blazing black eyes then he burst into a bitter laugh\\n\\n      well gentlemen you have the drop on me this time i seem to\\n      have knocked up against something hard but i came here in answer\\n      to a letter from mrs hilton cubitt dont tell me that she is in\\n      this dont tell me that she helped to set a trap for me\\n\\n      mrs hilton cubitt was seriously injured and is at deaths\\n      door\\n\\n      the man gave a hoarse cry of grief which rang through the house\\n\\n      youre crazy he cried fiercely it was he that was hurt not\\n      she who would have hurt little elsie i may have threatened\\n      hergod forgive mebut i would not have touched a hair of her\\n      pretty head take it backyou say that she is not hurt\\n\\n      she was found badly wounded by the side of her dead husband\\n\\n      he sank with a deep groan on the settee and buried his face in\\n      his manacled hands for five minutes he was silent then he\\n      raised his face once more and spoke with the cold composure of\\n      despair\\n\\n      i have nothing to hide from you gentlemen said he if i shot\\n      the man he had his shot at me and theres no murder in that but\\n      if you think i could have hurt that woman then you dont know\\n      either me or her i tell you there was never a man in this world\\n      loved a woman more than i loved her i had a right to her she\\n      was pledged to me years ago who was this englishman that he\\n      should come between us i tell you that i had the first right to\\n      her and that i was only claiming my own\\n\\n      she broke away from your influence when she found the man that\\n      you are said holmes sternly she fled from america to avoid\\n      you and she married an honourable gentleman in england you\\n      dogged her and followed her and made her life a misery to her in\\n      order to induce her to abandon the husband whom she loved and\\n      respected in order to fly with you whom she feared and hated\\n      you have ended by bringing about the death of a noble man and\\n      driving his wife to suicide that is your record in this\\n      business mr abe slaney and you will answer for it to the law\\n\\n      if elsie dies i care nothing what becomes of me said the\\n      american he opened one of his hands and looked at a note\\n      crumpled up in his palm see here mister he cried with a\\n      gleam of suspicion in his eyes youre not trying to scare me\\n      over this are you if the lady is hurt as bad as you say who\\n      was it that wrote this note he tossed it forward on to the\\n      table\\n\\n      i wrote it to bring you here\\n\\n      you wrote it there was no one on earth outside the joint who\\n      knew the secret of the dancing men how came you to write it\\n\\n      what one man can invent another can discover said holmes\\n      there is a cab coming to convey you to norwich mr slaney but\\n      meanwhile you have time to make some small reparation for the\\n      injury you have wrought are you aware that mrs hilton cubitt\\n      has herself lain under grave suspicion of the murder of her\\n      husband and that it was only my presence here and the knowledge\\n      which i happened to possess which has saved her from the\\n      accusation the least that you owe her is to make it clear to the\\n      whole world that she was in no way directly or indirectly\\n      responsible for his tragic end\\n\\n      i ask nothing better said the american i guess the very best\\n      case i can make for myself is the absolute naked truth\\n\\n      it is my duty to warn you that it will be used against you\\n      cried the inspector with the magnificent fair play of the\\n      british criminal law\\n\\n      slaney shrugged his shoulders\\n\\n      ill chance that said he first of all i want you gentlemen\\n      to understand that i have known this lady since she was a child\\n      there were seven of us in a gang in chicago and elsies father\\n      was the boss of the joint he was a clever man was old patrick\\n      it was he who invented that writing which would pass as a\\n      childs scrawl unless you just happened to have the key to it\\n      well elsie learned some of our ways but she couldnt stand the\\n      business and she had a bit of honest money of her own so she\\n      gave us all the slip and got away to london she had been engaged\\n      to me and she would have married me i believe if i had taken\\n      over another profession but she would have nothing to do with\\n      anything on the cross it was only after her marriage to this\\n      englishman that i was able to find out where she was i wrote to\\n      her but got no answer after that i came over and as letters\\n      were no use i put my messages where she could read them\\n\\n      well i have been here a month now i lived in that farm where\\n      i had a room down below and could get in and out every night\\n      and no one the wiser i tried all i could to coax elsie away i\\n      knew that she read the messages for once she wrote an answer\\n      under one of them then my temper got the better of me and i\\n      began to threaten her she sent me a letter then imploring me to\\n      go away and saying that it would break her heart if any scandal\\n      should come upon her husband she said that she would come down\\n      when her husband was asleep at three in the morning and speak\\n      with me through the end window if i would go away afterwards and\\n      leave her in peace she came down and brought money with her\\n      trying to bribe me to go this made me mad and i caught her arm\\n      and tried to pull her through the window at that moment in\\n      rushed the husband with his revolver in his hand elsie had sunk\\n      down upon the floor and we were face to face i was heeled also\\n      and i held up my gun to scare him off and let me get away he\\n      fired and missed me i pulled off almost at the same instant and\\n      down he dropped i made away across the garden and as i went i\\n      heard the window shut behind me thats gods truth gentlemen\\n      every word of it and i heard no more about it until that lad\\n      came riding up with a note which made me walk in here like a\\n      jay and give myself into your hands\\n\\n      a cab had driven up whilst the american had been talking two\\n      uniformed policemen sat inside inspector martin rose and touched\\n      his prisoner on the shoulder\\n\\n      it is time for us to go\\n\\n      can i see her first\\n\\n      no she is not conscious mr sherlock holmes i only hope that\\n      if ever again i have an important case i shall have the good\\n      fortune to have you by my side\\n\\n      we stood at the window and watched the cab drive away as i\\n      turned back my eye caught the pellet of paper which the prisoner\\n      had tossed upon the table it was the note with which holmes had\\n      decoyed him\\n\\n      see if you can read it watson said he with a smile\\n\\n      it contained no word but this little line of dancing men\\n\\n      comehereatonce\\n\\n      if you use the code which i have explained said holmes you\\n      will find that it simply means come here at once i was\\n      convinced that it was an invitation which he would not refuse\\n      since he could never imagine that it could come from anyone but\\n      the lady and so my dear watson we have ended by turning the\\n      dancing men to good when they have so often been the agents of\\n      evil and i think that i have fulfilled my promise of giving you\\n      something unusual for your notebook threeforty is our train\\n      and i fancy we should be back in baker street for dinner\\n\\n      only one word of epilogue the american abe slaney was\\n      condemned to death at the winter assizes at norwich but his\\n      penalty was changed to penal servitude in consideration of\\n      mitigating circumstances and the certainty that hilton cubitt\\n      had fired the first shot of mrs hilton cubitt i only know that\\n      i have heard she recovered entirely and that she still remains a\\n      widow devoting her whole life to the care of the poor and to the\\n      administration of her husbands estate\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe adventure of the solitary cyclist\\n\\n\\n      from the years  to  inclusive mr sherlock holmes was a\\n      very busy man it is safe to say that there was no public case of\\n      any difficulty in which he was not consulted during those eight\\n      years and there were hundreds of private cases some of them of\\n      the most intricate and extraordinary character in which he\\n      played a prominent part many startling successes and a few\\n      unavoidable failures were the outcome of this long period of\\n      continuous work as i have preserved very full notes of all these\\n      cases and was myself personally engaged in many of them it may\\n      be imagined that it is no easy task to know which i should select\\n      to lay before the public i shall however preserve my former\\n      rule and give the preference to those cases which derive their\\n      interest not so much from the brutality of the crime as from the\\n      ingenuity and dramatic quality of the solution for this reason i\\n      will now lay before the reader the facts connected with miss\\n      violet smith the solitary cyclist of charlington and the\\n      curious sequel of our investigation which culminated in\\n      unexpected tragedy it is true that the circumstance did not\\n      admit of any striking illustration of those powers for which my\\n      friend was famous but there were some points about the case\\n      which made it stand out in those long records of crime from which\\n      i gather the material for these little narratives\\n\\n      on referring to my notebook for the year  i find that it was\\n      upon saturday the rd of april that we first heard of miss\\n      violet smith her visit was i remember extremely unwelcome to\\n      holmes for he was immersed at the moment in a very abstruse and\\n      complicated problem concerning the peculiar persecution to which\\n      john vincent harden the wellknown tobacco millionaire had been\\n      subjected my friend who loved above all things precision and\\n      concentration of thought resented anything which distracted his\\n      attention from the matter in hand and yet without a harshness\\n      which was foreign to his nature it was impossible to refuse to\\n      listen to the story of the young and beautiful woman tall\\n      graceful and queenly who presented herself at baker street late\\n      in the evening and implored his assistance and advice it was\\n      vain to urge that his time was already fully occupied for the\\n      young lady had come with the determination to tell her story and\\n      it was evident that nothing short of force could get her out of\\n      the room until she had done so with a resigned air and a\\n      somewhat weary smile holmes begged the beautiful intruder to\\n      take a seat and to inform us what it was that was troubling her\\n\\n      at least it cannot be your health said he as his keen eyes\\n      darted over her so ardent a bicyclist must be full of energy\\n\\n      she glanced down in surprise at her own feet and i observed the\\n      slight roughening of the side of the sole caused by the friction\\n      of the edge of the pedal\\n\\n      yes i bicycle a good deal mr holmes and that has something\\n      to do with my visit to you today\\n\\n      my friend took the ladys ungloved hand and examined it with as\\n      close an attention and as little sentiment as a scientist would\\n      show to a specimen\\n\\n      you will excuse me i am sure it is my business said he as\\n      he dropped it i nearly fell into the error of supposing that\\n      you were typewriting of course it is obvious that it is music\\n      you observe the spatulate fingerends watson which is common to\\n      both professions there is a spirituality about the face\\n      howevershe gently turned it towards the lightwhich the\\n      typewriter does not generate this lady is a musician\\n\\n      yes mr holmes i teach music\\n\\n      in the country i presume from your complexion\\n\\n      yes sir near farnham on the borders of surrey\\n\\n      a beautiful neighbourhood and full of the most interesting\\n      associations you remember watson that it was near there that\\n      we took archie stamford the forger now miss violet what has\\n      happened to you near farnham on the borders of surrey\\n\\n      the young lady with great clearness and composure made the\\n      following curious statement\\n\\n      my father is dead mr holmes he was james smith who conducted\\n      the orchestra at the old imperial theatre my mother and i were\\n      left without a relation in the world except one uncle ralph\\n      smith who went to africa twentyfive years ago and we have\\n      never had a word from him since when father died we were left\\n      very poor but one day we were told that there was an\\n      advertisement in the times inquiring for our whereabouts you\\n      can imagine how excited we were for we thought that someone had\\n      left us a fortune we went at once to the lawyer whose name was\\n      given in the paper there we met two gentlemen mr carruthers\\n      and mr woodley who were home on a visit from south africa they\\n      said that my uncle was a friend of theirs that he had died some\\n      months before in great poverty in johannesburg and that he had\\n      asked them with his last breath to hunt up his relations and see\\n      that they were in no want it seemed strange to us that uncle\\n      ralph who took no notice of us when he was alive should be so\\n      careful to look after us when he was dead but mr carruthers\\n      explained that the reason was that my uncle had just heard of the\\n      death of his brother and so felt responsible for our fate\\n\\n      excuse me said holmes when was this interview\\n\\n      last decemberfour months ago\\n\\n      pray proceed\\n\\n      mr woodley seemed to me to be a most odious person he was for\\n      ever making eyes at mea coarse puffyfaced redmoustached\\n      young man with his hair plastered down on each side of his\\n      forehead i thought that he was perfectly hatefuland i was sure\\n      that cyril would not wish me to know such a person\\n\\n      oh cyril is his name said holmes smiling\\n\\n      the young lady blushed and laughed\\n\\n      yes mr holmes cyril morton an electrical engineer and we\\n      hope to be married at the end of the summer dear me how did i\\n      get talking about him what i wished to say was that mr woodley\\n      was perfectly odious but that mr carruthers who was a much\\n      older man was more agreeable he was a dark sallow\\n      cleanshaven silent person but he had polite manners and a\\n      pleasant smile he inquired how we were left and on finding that\\n      we were very poor he suggested that i should come and teach\\n      music to his only daughter aged ten i said that i did not like\\n      to leave my mother on which he suggested that i should go home\\n      to her every weekend and he offered me a hundred a year which\\n      was certainly splendid pay so it ended by my accepting and i\\n      went down to chiltern grange about six miles from farnham mr\\n      carruthers was a widower but he had engaged a lady housekeeper\\n      a very respectable elderly person called mrs dixon to look\\n      after his establishment the child was a dear and everything\\n      promised well mr carruthers was very kind and very musical and\\n      we had most pleasant evenings together every weekend i went\\n      home to my mother in town\\n\\n      the first flaw in my happiness was the arrival of the\\n      redmoustached mr woodley he came for a visit of a week and\\n      oh it seemed three months to me he was a dreadful persona\\n      bully to everyone else but to me something infinitely worse he\\n      made odious love to me boasted of his wealth said that if i\\n      married him i could have the finest diamonds in london and\\n      finally when i would have nothing to do with him he seized me\\n      in his arms one day after dinnerhe was hideously strongand\\n      swore that he would not let me go until i had kissed him mr\\n      carruthers came in and tore him from me on which he turned upon\\n      his own host knocking him down and cutting his face open that\\n      was the end of his visit as you can imagine mr carruthers\\n      apologized to me next day and assured me that i should never be\\n      exposed to such an insult again i have not seen mr woodley\\n      since\\n\\n      and now mr holmes i come at last to the special thing which\\n      has caused me to ask your advice today you must know that every\\n      saturday forenoon i ride on my bicycle to farnham station in\\n      order to get the  to town the road from chiltern grange is\\n      a lonely one and at one spot it is particularly so for it lies\\n      for over a mile between charlington heath upon one side and the\\n      woods which lie round charlington hall upon the other you could\\n      not find a more lonely tract of road anywhere and it is quite\\n      rare to meet so much as a cart or a peasant until you reach the\\n      high road near crooksbury hill two weeks ago i was passing this\\n      place when i chanced to look back over my shoulder and about\\n      two hundred yards behind me i saw a man also on a bicycle he\\n      seemed to be a middleaged man with a short dark beard i\\n      looked back before i reached farnham but the man was gone so i\\n      thought no more about it but you can imagine how surprised i\\n      was mr holmes when on my return on the monday i saw the same\\n      man on the same stretch of road my astonishment was increased\\n      when the incident occurred again exactly as before on the\\n      following saturday and monday he always kept his distance and\\n      did not molest me in any way but still it certainly was very\\n      odd i mentioned it to mr carruthers who seemed interested in\\n      what i said and told me that he had ordered a horse and trap so\\n      that in future i should not pass over these lonely roads without\\n      some companion\\n\\n      the horse and trap were to have come this week but for some\\n      reason they were not delivered and again i had to cycle to the\\n      station that was this morning you can think that i looked out\\n      when i came to charlington heath and there sure enough was the\\n      man exactly as he had been the two weeks before he always kept\\n      so far from me that i could not clearly see his face but it was\\n      certainly someone whom i did not know he was dressed in a dark\\n      suit with a cloth cap the only thing about his face that i could\\n      clearly see was his dark beard today i was not alarmed but i\\n      was filled with curiosity and i determined to find out who he\\n      was and what he wanted i slowed down my machine but he slowed\\n      down his then i stopped altogether but he stopped also then i\\n      laid a trap for him there is a sharp turning of the road and i\\n      pedalled very quickly round this and then i stopped and waited\\n      i expected him to shoot round and pass me before he could stop\\n      but he never appeared then i went back and looked round the\\n      corner i could see a mile of road but he was not on it to make\\n      it the more extraordinary there was no side road at this point\\n      down which he could have gone\\n\\n      holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands this case certainly\\n      presents some features of its own said he how much time\\n      elapsed between your turning the corner and your discovery that\\n      the road was clear\\n\\n      two or three minutes\\n\\n      then he could not have retreated down the road and you say that\\n      there are no side roads\\n\\n      none\\n\\n      then he certainly took a footpath on one side or the other\\n\\n      it could not have been on the side of the heath or i should\\n      have seen him\\n\\n      so by the process of exclusion we arrive at the fact that he\\n      made his way toward charlington hall which as i understand is\\n      situated in its own grounds on one side of the road anything\\n      else\\n\\n      nothing mr holmes save that i was so perplexed that i felt i\\n      should not be happy until i had seen you and had your advice\\n\\n      holmes sat in silence for some little time\\n\\n      where is the gentleman to whom you are engaged he asked at\\n      last\\n\\n      he is in the midland electrical company at coventry\\n\\n      he would not pay you a surprise visit\\n\\n      oh mr holmes as if i should not know him\\n\\n      have you had any other admirers\\n\\n      several before i knew cyril\\n\\n      and since\\n\\n      there was this dreadful man woodley if you can call him an\\n      admirer\\n\\n      no one else\\n\\n      our fair client seemed a little confused\\n\\n      who was he asked holmes\\n\\n      oh it may be a mere fancy of mine but it had seemed to me\\n      sometimes that my employer mr carruthers takes a great deal of\\n      interest in me we are thrown rather together i play his\\n      accompaniments in the evening he has never said anything he is\\n      a perfect gentleman but a girl always knows\\n\\n      ha holmes looked grave what does he do for a living\\n\\n      he is a rich man\\n\\n      no carriages or horses\\n\\n      well at least he is fairly welltodo but he goes into the\\n      city two or three times a week he is deeply interested in south\\n      african gold shares\\n\\n      you will let me know any fresh development miss smith i am\\n      very busy just now but i will find time to make some inquiries\\n      into your case in the meantime take no step without letting me\\n      know goodbye and i trust that we shall have nothing but good\\n      news from you\\n\\n      it is part of the settled order of nature that such a girl\\n      should have followers said holmes he pulled at his meditative\\n      pipe but for choice not on bicycles in lonely country roads\\n      some secretive lover beyond all doubt but there are curious and\\n      suggestive details about the case watson\\n\\n      that he should appear only at that point\\n\\n      exactly our first effort must be to find who are the tenants of\\n      charlington hall then again how about the connection between\\n      carruthers and woodley since they appear to be men of such a\\n      different type how came they both to be so keen upon looking\\n      up ralph smiths relations one more point what sort of a\\n      mnage is it which pays double the market price for a governess\\n      but does not keep a horse although six miles from the station\\n      odd watsonvery odd\\n\\n      you will go down\\n\\n      no my dear fellow you will go down this may be some\\n      trifling intrigue and i cannot break my other important research\\n      for the sake of it on monday you will arrive early at farnham\\n      you will conceal yourself near charlington heath you will\\n      observe these facts for yourself and act as your own judgment\\n      advises then having inquired as to the occupants of the hall\\n      you will come back to me and report and now watson not another\\n      word of the matter until we have a few solid steppingstones on\\n      which we may hope to get across to our solution\\n\\n      we had ascertained from the lady that she went down upon the\\n      monday by the train which leaves waterloo at  so i started\\n      early and caught the  at farnham station i had no difficulty\\n      in being directed to charlington heath it was impossible to\\n      mistake the scene of the young ladys adventure for the road\\n      runs between the open heath on one side and an old yew hedge upon\\n      the other surrounding a park which is studded with magnificent\\n      trees there was a main gateway of lichenstudded stone each\\n      side pillar surmounted by mouldering heraldic emblems but\\n      besides this central carriage drive i observed several points\\n      where there were gaps in the hedge and paths leading through\\n      them the house was invisible from the road but the surroundings\\n      all spoke of gloom and decay\\n\\n      the heath was covered with golden patches of flowering gorse\\n      gleaming magnificently in the light of the bright spring\\n      sunshine behind one of these clumps i took up my position so as\\n      to command both the gateway of the hall and a long stretch of the\\n      road upon either side it had been deserted when i left it but\\n      now i saw a cyclist riding down it from the opposite direction to\\n      that in which i had come he was clad in a dark suit and i saw\\n      that he had a black beard on reaching the end of the charlington\\n      grounds he sprang from his machine and led it through a gap in\\n      the hedge disappearing from my view\\n\\n      a quarter of an hour passed and then a second cyclist appeared\\n      this time it was the young lady coming from the station i saw\\n      her look about her as she came to the charlington hedge an\\n      instant later the man emerged from his hidingplace sprang upon\\n      his cycle and followed her in all the broad landscape those\\n      were the only moving figures the graceful girl sitting very\\n      straight upon her machine and the man behind her bending low\\n      over his handlebar with a curiously furtive suggestion in every\\n      movement she looked back at him and slowed her pace he slowed\\n      also she stopped he at once stopped too keeping two hundred\\n      yards behind her her next movement was as unexpected as it was\\n      spirited she suddenly whisked her wheels round and dashed\\n      straight at him he was as quick as she however and darted off\\n      in desperate flight presently she came back up the road again\\n      her head haughtily in the air not deigning to take any further\\n      notice of her silent attendant he had turned also and still\\n      kept his distance until the curve of the road hid them from my\\n      sight\\n\\n      i remained in my hidingplace and it was well that i did so for\\n      presently the man reappeared cycling slowly back he turned in\\n      at the hall gates and dismounted from his machine for some\\n      minutes i could see him standing among the trees his hands were\\n      raised and he seemed to be settling his necktie then he mounted\\n      his cycle and rode away from me down the drive towards the hall\\n      i ran across the heath and peered through the trees far away i\\n      could catch glimpses of the old grey building with its bristling\\n      tudor chimneys but the drive ran through a dense shrubbery and\\n      i saw no more of my man\\n\\n      however it seemed to me that i had done a fairly good mornings\\n      work and i walked back in high spirits to farnham the local\\n      house agent could tell me nothing about charlington hall and\\n      referred me to a wellknown firm in pall mall there i halted on\\n      my way home and met with courtesy from the representative no i\\n      could not have charlington hall for the summer i was just too\\n      late it had been let about a month ago mr williamson was the\\n      name of the tenant he was a respectable elderly gentleman the\\n      polite agent was afraid he could say no more as the affairs of\\n      his clients were not matters which he could discuss\\n\\n      mr sherlock holmes listened with attention to the long report\\n      which i was able to present to him that evening but it did not\\n      elicit that word of curt praise which i had hoped for and should\\n      have valued on the contrary his austere face was even more\\n      severe than usual as he commented upon the things that i had done\\n      and the things that i had not\\n\\n      your hidingplace my dear watson was very faulty you should\\n      have been behind the hedge then you would have had a close view\\n      of this interesting person as it is you were some hundreds of\\n      yards away and can tell me even less than miss smith she thinks\\n      she does not know the man i am convinced she does why\\n      otherwise should he be so desperately anxious that she should\\n      not get so near him as to see his features you describe him as\\n      bending over the handlebar concealment again you see you\\n      really have done remarkably badly he returns to the house and\\n      you want to find out who he is you come to a london house\\n      agent\\n\\n      what should i have done i cried with some heat\\n\\n      gone to the nearest publichouse that is the centre of country\\n      gossip they would have told you every name from the master to\\n      the scullerymaid williamson it conveys nothing to my mind if\\n      he is an elderly man he is not this active cyclist who sprints\\n      away from that young ladys athletic pursuit what have we gained\\n      by your expedition the knowledge that the girls story is true\\n      i never doubted it that there is a connection between the\\n      cyclist and the hall i never doubted that either that the hall\\n      is tenanted by williamson whos the better for that well well\\n      my dear sir dont look so depressed we can do little more until\\n      next saturday and in the meantime i may make one or two\\n      inquiries myself\\n\\n      next morning we had a note from miss smith recounting shortly\\n      and accurately the very incidents which i had seen but the pith\\n      of the letter lay in the postscript\\n\\n      i am sure that you will respect my confidence mr holmes when\\n      i tell you that my place here has become difficult owing to the\\n      fact that my employer has proposed marriage to me i am convinced\\n      that his feelings are most deep and most honourable at the same\\n      time my promise is of course given he took my refusal very\\n      seriously but also very gently you can understand however\\n      that the situation is a little strained\\n\\n      our young friend seems to be getting into deep waters said\\n      holmes thoughtfully as he finished the letter the case\\n      certainly presents more features of interest and more possibility\\n      of development than i had originally thought i should be none\\n      the worse for a quiet peaceful day in the country and i am\\n      inclined to run down this afternoon and test one or two theories\\n      which i have formed\\n\\n      holmess quiet day in the country had a singular termination for\\n      he arrived at baker street late in the evening with a cut lip\\n      and a discoloured lump upon his forehead besides a general air\\n      of dissipation which would have made his own person the fitting\\n      object of a scotland yard investigation he was immensely tickled\\n      by his own adventures and laughed heartily as he recounted them\\n\\n      i get so little active exercise that it is always a treat said\\n      he you are aware that i have some proficiency in the good old\\n      british sport of boxing occasionally it is of service today\\n      for example i should have come to very ignominious grief without\\n      it\\n\\n      i begged him to tell me what had occurred\\n\\n      i found that country pub which i had already recommended to your\\n      notice and there i made my discreet inquiries i was in the bar\\n      and a garrulous landlord was giving me all that i wanted\\n      williamson is a whitebearded man and he lives alone with a\\n      small staff of servants at the hall there is some rumour that he\\n      is or has been a clergyman but one or two incidents of his short\\n      residence at the hall struck me as peculiarly unecclesiastical i\\n      have already made some inquiries at a clerical agency and they\\n      tell me that there was a man of that name in orders whose\\n      career has been a singularly dark one the landlord further\\n      informed me that there are usually weekend visitorsa warm lot\\n      sirat the hall and especially one gentleman with a red\\n      moustache mr woodley by name who was always there we had got\\n      as far as this when who should walk in but the gentleman\\n      himself who had been drinking his beer in the taproom and had\\n      heard the whole conversation who was i what did i want what\\n      did i mean by asking questions he had a fine flow of language\\n      and his adjectives were very vigorous he ended a string of abuse\\n      by a vicious backhander which i failed to entirely avoid the\\n      next few minutes were delicious it was a straight left against a\\n      slogging ruffian i emerged as you see me mr woodley went home\\n      in a cart so ended my country trip and it must be confessed\\n      that however enjoyable my day on the surrey border has not been\\n      much more profitable than your own\\n\\n      the thursday brought us another letter from our client\\n\\n          you will not be surprised mr holmes said she to hear\\n          that i am leaving mr carrutherss employment even the high\\n          pay cannot reconcile me to the discomforts of my situation\\n          on saturday i come up to town and i do not intend to return\\n          mr carruthers has got a trap and so the dangers of the\\n          lonely road if there ever were any dangers are now over\\n      as to the special cause of my leaving it is not merely the\\n      strained situation with mr carruthers but it is the\\n      reappearance of that odious man mr woodley he was always\\n      hideous but he looks more awful than ever now for he appears to\\n      have had an accident and he is much disfigured i saw him out of\\n      the window but i am glad to say i did not meet him he had a\\n      long talk with mr carruthers who seemed much excited\\n      afterwards woodley must be staying in the neighbourhood for he\\n      did not sleep here and yet i caught a glimpse of him again this\\n      morning slinking about in the shrubbery i would sooner have a\\n      savage wild animal loose about the place i loathe and fear him\\n      more than i can say how can mr carruthers endure such a\\n      creature for a moment however all my troubles will be over on\\n      saturday\\n\\n      so i trust watson so i trust said holmes gravely there is\\n      some deep intrigue going on round that little woman and it is\\n      our duty to see that no one molests her upon that last journey i\\n      think watson that we must spare time to run down together on\\n      saturday morning and make sure that this curious and inclusive\\n      investigation has no untoward ending\\n\\n      i confess that i had not up to now taken a very serious view of\\n      the case which had seemed to me rather grotesque and bizarre\\n      than dangerous that a man should lie in wait for and follow a\\n      very handsome woman is no unheardof thing and if he has so\\n      little audacity that he not only dared not address her but even\\n      fled from her approach he was not a very formidable assailant\\n      the ruffian woodley was a very different person but except on\\n      one occasion he had not molested our client and now he visited\\n      the house of carruthers without intruding upon her presence the\\n      man on the bicycle was doubtless a member of those weekend\\n      parties at the hall of which the publican had spoken but who he\\n      was or what he wanted was as obscure as ever it was the\\n      severity of holmess manner and the fact that he slipped a\\n      revolver into his pocket before leaving our rooms which impressed\\n      me with the feeling that tragedy might prove to lurk behind this\\n      curious train of events\\n\\n      a rainy night had been followed by a glorious morning and the\\n      heathcovered countryside with the glowing clumps of flowering\\n      gorse seemed all the more beautiful to eyes which were weary of\\n      the duns and drabs and slate greys of london holmes and i walked\\n      along the broad sandy road inhaling the fresh morning air and\\n      rejoicing in the music of the birds and the fresh breath of the\\n      spring from a rise of the road on the shoulder of crooksbury\\n      hill we could see the grim hall bristling out from amidst the\\n      ancient oaks which old as they were were still younger than\\n      the building which they surrounded holmes pointed down the long\\n      tract of road which wound a reddish yellow band between the\\n      brown of the heath and the budding green of the woods far away\\n      a black dot we could see a vehicle moving in our direction\\n      holmes gave an exclamation of impatience\\n\\n      i have given a margin of half an hour said he if that is her\\n      trap she must be making for the earlier train i fear watson\\n      that she will be past charlington before we can possibly meet\\n      her\\n\\n      from the instant that we passed the rise we could no longer see\\n      the vehicle but we hastened onward at such a pace that my\\n      sedentary life began to tell upon me and i was compelled to fall\\n      behind holmes however was always in training for he had\\n      inexhaustible stores of nervous energy upon which to draw his\\n      springy step never slowed until suddenly when he was a hundred\\n      yards in front of me he halted and i saw him throw up his hand\\n      with a gesture of grief and despair at the same instant an empty\\n      dogcart the horse cantering the reins trailing appeared round\\n      the curve of the road and rattled swiftly towards us\\n\\n      too late watson too late cried holmes as i ran panting to\\n      his side fool that i was not to allow for that earlier train\\n      its abduction watsonabduction murder heaven knows what\\n      block the road stop the horse thats right now jump in and\\n      let us see if i can repair the consequences of my own blunder\\n\\n      we had sprung into the dogcart and holmes after turning the\\n      horse gave it a sharp cut with the whip and we flew back along\\n      the road as we turned the curve the whole stretch of road\\n      between the hall and the heath was opened up i grasped holmess\\n      arm\\n\\n      thats the man i gasped\\n\\n      a solitary cyclist was coming towards us his head was down and\\n      his shoulders rounded as he put every ounce of energy that he\\n      possessed on to the pedals he was flying like a racer suddenly\\n      he raised his bearded face saw us close to him and pulled up\\n      springing from his machine that coalblack beard was in singular\\n      contrast to the pallor of his face and his eyes were as bright\\n      as if he had a fever he stared at us and at the dogcart then a\\n      look of amazement came over his face\\n\\n      halloa stop there he shouted holding his bicycle to block\\n      our road where did you get that dogcart pull up man he\\n      yelled drawing a pistol from his side pocket pull up i say\\n      or by george ill put a bullet into your horse\\n\\n      holmes threw the reins into my lap and sprang down from the cart\\n\\n      youre the man we want to see where is miss violet smith he\\n      said in his quick clear way\\n\\n      thats what im asking you youre in her dogcart you ought to\\n      know where she is\\n\\n      we met the dogcart on the road there was no one in it we\\n      drove back to help the young lady\\n\\n      good lord good lord what shall i do cried the stranger in\\n      an ecstasy of despair theyve got her that hellhound woodley\\n      and the blackguard parson come man come if you really are her\\n      friend stand by me and well save her if i have to leave my\\n      carcass in charlington wood\\n\\n      he ran distractedly his pistol in his hand towards a gap in the\\n      hedge holmes followed him and i leaving the horse grazing\\n      beside the road followed holmes\\n\\n      this is where they came through said he pointing to the marks\\n      of several feet upon the muddy path halloa stop a minute\\n      whos this in the bush\\n\\n      it was a young fellow about seventeen dressed like an ostler\\n      with leather cords and gaiters he lay upon his back his knees\\n      drawn up a terrible cut upon his head he was insensible but\\n      alive a glance at his wound told me that it had not penetrated\\n      the bone\\n\\n      thats peter the groom cried the stranger he drove her the\\n      beasts have pulled him off and clubbed him let him lie we cant\\n      do him any good but we may save her from the worst fate that can\\n      befall a woman\\n\\n      we ran frantically down the path which wound among the trees we\\n      had reached the shrubbery which surrounded the house when holmes\\n      pulled up\\n\\n      they didnt go to the house here are their marks on the\\n      lefthere beside the laurel bushes ah i said so\\n\\n      as he spoke a womans shrill screama scream which vibrated with\\n      a frenzy of horrorburst from the thick green clump of bushes in\\n      front of us it ended suddenly on its highest note with a choke\\n      and a gurgle\\n\\n      this way this way they are in the bowlingalley cried the\\n      stranger darting through the bushes ah the cowardly dogs\\n      follow me gentlemen too late too late by the living jingo\\n\\n      we had broken suddenly into a lovely glade of greensward\\n      surrounded by ancient trees on the farther side of it under the\\n      shadow of a mighty oak there stood a singular group of three\\n      people one was a woman our client drooping and faint a\\n      handkerchief round her mouth opposite her stood a brutal\\n      heavyfaced redmoustached young man his gaitered legs parted\\n      wide one arm akimbo the other waving a riding crop his whole\\n      attitude suggestive of triumphant bravado between them an\\n      elderly greybearded man wearing a short surplice over a light\\n      tweed suit had evidently just completed the wedding service for\\n      he pocketed his prayerbook as we appeared and slapped the\\n      sinister bridegroom upon the back in jovial congratulation\\n\\n      theyre married i gasped\\n\\n      come on cried our guide come on he rushed across the\\n      glade holmes and i at his heels as we approached the lady\\n      staggered against the trunk of the tree for support williamson\\n      the exclergyman bowed to us with mock politeness and the\\n      bully woodley advanced with a shout of brutal and exultant\\n      laughter\\n\\n      you can take your beard off bob said he i know you right\\n      enough well you and your pals have just come in time for me to\\n      be able to introduce you to mrs woodley\\n\\n      our guides answer was a singular one he snatched off the dark\\n      beard which had disguised him and threw it on the ground\\n      disclosing a long sallow cleanshaven face below it then he\\n      raised his revolver and covered the young ruffian who was\\n      advancing upon him with his dangerous ridingcrop swinging in his\\n      hand\\n\\n      yes said our ally i am bob carruthers and ill see this\\n      woman righted if i have to swing for it i told you what id do\\n      if you molested her and by the lord ill be as good as my\\n      word\\n\\n      youre too late shes my wife\\n\\n      no shes your widow\\n\\n      his revolver cracked and i saw the blood spurt from the front of\\n      woodleys waistcoat he spun round with a scream and fell upon\\n      his back his hideous red face turning suddenly to a dreadful\\n      mottled pallor the old man still clad in his surplice burst\\n      into such a string of foul oaths as i have never heard and\\n      pulled out a revolver of his own but before he could raise it\\n      he was looking down the barrel of holmess weapon\\n\\n      enough of this said my friend coldly drop that pistol\\n      watson pick it up hold it to his head thank you you\\n      carruthers give me that revolver well have no more violence\\n      come hand it over\\n\\n      who are you then\\n\\n      my name is sherlock holmes\\n\\n      good lord\\n\\n      you have heard of me i see i will represent the official\\n      police until their arrival here you he shouted to a\\n      frightened groom who had appeared at the edge of the glade\\n      come here take this note as hard as you can ride to farnham\\n      he scribbled a few words upon a leaf from his notebook give it\\n      to the superintendent at the policestation until he comes i\\n      must detain you all under my personal custody\\n\\n      the strong masterful personality of holmes dominated the tragic\\n      scene and all were equally puppets in his hands williamson and\\n      carruthers found themselves carrying the wounded woodley into the\\n      house and i gave my arm to the frightened girl the injured man\\n      was laid on his bed and at holmess request i examined him i\\n      carried my report to where he sat in the old tapestryhung\\n      diningroom with his two prisoners before him\\n\\n      he will live said i\\n\\n      what cried carruthers springing out of his chair ill go\\n      upstairs and finish him first do you tell me that that angel is\\n      to be tied to roaring jack woodley for life\\n\\n      you need not concern yourself about that said holmes there\\n      are two very good reasons why she should under no circumstances\\n      be his wife in the first place we are very safe in questioning\\n      mr williamsons right to solemnize a marriage\\n\\n      i have been ordained cried the old rascal\\n\\n      and also unfrocked\\n\\n      once a clergyman always a clergyman\\n\\n      i think not how about the license\\n\\n      we had a license for the marriage i have it here in my pocket\\n\\n      then you got it by trick but in any case a forced marriage is\\n      no marriage but it is a very serious felony as you will\\n      discover before you have finished youll have time to think the\\n      point out during the next ten years or so unless i am mistaken\\n      as to you carruthers you would have done better to keep your\\n      pistol in your pocket\\n\\n      i begin to think so mr holmes but when i thought of all the\\n      precaution i had taken to shield this girlfor i loved her mr\\n      holmes and it is the only time that ever i knew what love wasit\\n      fairly drove me mad to think that she was in the power of the\\n      greatest brute and bully in south africaa man whose name is a\\n      holy terror from kimberley to johannesburg why mr holmes\\n      youll hardly believe it but ever since that girl has been in my\\n      employment i never once let her go past this house where i knew\\n      the rascals were lurking without following her on my bicycle\\n      just to see that she came to no harm i kept my distance from\\n      her and i wore a beard so that she should not recognize me for\\n      she is a good and highspirited girl and she wouldnt have\\n      stayed in my employment long if she had thought that i was\\n      following her about the country roads\\n\\n      why didnt you tell her of her danger\\n\\n      because then again she would have left me and i couldnt bear\\n      to face that even if she couldnt love me it was a great deal\\n      to me just to see her dainty form about the house and to hear\\n      the sound of her voice\\n\\n      well said i you call that love mr carruthers but i should\\n      call it selfishness\\n\\n      maybe the two things go together anyhow i couldnt let her go\\n      besides with this crowd about it was well that she should have\\n      someone near to look after her then when the cable came i knew\\n      they were bound to make a move\\n\\n      what cable\\n\\n      carruthers took a telegram from his pocket\\n\\n      thats it said he\\n\\n      it was short and concise\\n\\n      the old man is dead\\n\\n      hum said holmes i think i see how things worked and i can\\n      understand how this message would as you say bring them to a\\n      head but while you wait you might tell me what you can\\n\\n      the old reprobate with the surplice burst into a volley of bad\\n      language\\n\\n      by heaven said he if you squeal on us bob carruthers ill\\n      serve you as you served jack woodley you can bleat about the\\n      girl to your hearts content for thats your own affair but if\\n      you round on your pals to this plainclothes copper it will be\\n      the worst days work that ever you did\\n\\n      your reverence need not be excited said holmes lighting a\\n      cigarette the case is clear enough against you and all i ask\\n      is a few details for my private curiosity however if theres\\n      any difficulty in your telling me ill do the talking and then\\n      you will see how far you have a chance of holding back your\\n      secrets in the first place three of you came from south africa\\n      on this gameyou williamson you carruthers and woodley\\n\\n      lie number one said the old man i never saw either of them\\n      until two months ago and i have never been in africa in my life\\n      so you can put that in your pipe and smoke it mr busybody\\n      holmes\\n\\n      what he says is true said carruthers\\n\\n      well well two of you came over his reverence is our own\\n      homemade article you had known ralph smith in south africa you\\n      had reason to believe he would not live long you found out that\\n      his niece would inherit his fortune hows thateh\\n\\n      carruthers nodded and williamson swore\\n\\n      she was next of kin no doubt and you were aware that the old\\n      fellow would make no will\\n\\n      couldnt read or write said carruthers\\n\\n      so you came over the two of you and hunted up the girl the\\n      idea was that one of you was to marry her and the other have a\\n      share of the plunder for some reason woodley was chosen as the\\n      husband why was that\\n\\n      we played cards for her on the voyage he won\\n\\n      i see you got the young lady into your service and there\\n      woodley was to do the courting she recognized the drunken brute\\n      that he was and would have nothing to do with him meanwhile\\n      your arrangement was rather upset by the fact that you had\\n      yourself fallen in love with the lady you could no longer bear\\n      the idea of this ruffian owning her\\n\\n      no by george i couldnt\\n\\n      there was a quarrel between you he left you in a rage and\\n      began to make his own plans independently of you\\n\\n      it strikes me williamson there isnt very much that we can\\n      tell this gentleman cried carruthers with a bitter laugh\\n      yes we quarreled and he knocked me down i am level with him\\n      on that anyhow then i lost sight of him that was when he\\n      picked up with this outcast padre here i found that they had set\\n      up housekeeping together at this place on the line that she had\\n      to pass for the station i kept my eye on her after that for i\\n      knew there was some devilry in the wind i saw them from time to\\n      time for i was anxious to know what they were after two days\\n      ago woodley came up to my house with this cable which showed\\n      that ralph smith was dead he asked me if i would stand by the\\n      bargain i said i would not he asked me if i would marry the\\n      girl myself and give him a share i said i would willingly do so\\n      but that she would not have me he said let us get her married\\n      first and after a week or two she may see things a bit\\n      different i said i would have nothing to do with violence so\\n      he went off cursing like the foulmouthed blackguard that he\\n      was and swearing that he would have her yet she was leaving me\\n      this weekend and i had got a trap to take her to the station\\n      but i was so uneasy in my mind that i followed her on my bicycle\\n      she had got a start however and before i could catch her the\\n      mischief was done the first thing i knew about it was when i saw\\n      you two gentlemen driving back in her dogcart\\n\\n      holmes rose and tossed the end of his cigarette into the grate\\n      i have been very obtuse watson said he when in your report\\n      you said that you had seen the cyclist as you thought arrange his\\n      necktie in the shrubbery that alone should have told me all\\n      however we may congratulate ourselves upon a curious and in\\n      some respects a unique case i perceive three of the county\\n      constabulary in the drive and i am glad to see that the little\\n      ostler is able to keep pace with them so it is likely that\\n      neither he nor the interesting bridegroom will be permanently\\n      damaged by their mornings adventures i think watson that in\\n      your medical capacity you might wait upon miss smith and tell\\n      her that if she is sufficiently recovered we shall be happy to\\n      escort her to her mothers home if she is not quite convalescent\\n      you will find that a hint that we were about to telegraph to a\\n      young electrician in the midlands would probably complete the\\n      cure as to you mr carruthers i think that you have done what\\n      you could to make amends for your share in an evil plot there is\\n      my card sir and if my evidence can be of help in your trial it\\n      shall be at your disposal\\n\\n      in the whirl of our incessant activity it has often been\\n      difficult for me as the reader has probably observed to round\\n      off my narratives and to give those final details which the\\n      curious might expect each case has been the prelude to another\\n      and the crisis once over the actors have passed for ever out of\\n      our busy lives i find however a short note at the end of my\\n      manuscript dealing with this case in which i have put it upon\\n      record that miss violet smith did indeed inherit a large fortune\\n      and that she is now the wife of cyril morton the senior partner\\n      of morton  kennedy the famous westminster electricians\\n      williamson and woodley were both tried for abduction and assault\\n      the former getting seven years the latter ten of the fate of\\n      carruthers i have no record but i am sure that his assault was\\n      not viewed very gravely by the court since woodley had the\\n      reputation of being a most dangerous ruffian and i think that a\\n      few months were sufficient to satisfy the demands of justice\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe adventure of the priory school\\n\\n\\n      we have had some dramatic entrances and exits upon our small\\n      stage at baker street but i cannot recollect anything more\\n      sudden and startling than the first appearance of thorneycroft\\n      huxtable ma phd etc his card which seemed too small to\\n      carry the weight of his academic distinctions preceded him by a\\n      few seconds and then he entered himselfso large so pompous\\n      and so dignified that he was the very embodiment of\\n      selfpossession and solidity and yet his first action when the\\n      door had closed behind him was to stagger against the table\\n      whence he slipped down upon the floor and there was that\\n      majestic figure prostrate and insensible upon our bearskin\\n      hearthrug\\n\\n      we had sprung to our feet and for a few moments we stared in\\n      silent amazement at this ponderous piece of wreckage which told\\n      of some sudden and fatal storm far out on the ocean of life then\\n      holmes hurried with a cushion for his head and i with brandy for\\n      his lips the heavy white face was seamed with lines of trouble\\n      the hanging pouches under the closed eyes were leaden in colour\\n      the loose mouth drooped dolorously at the corners the rolling\\n      chins were unshaven collar and shirt bore the grime of a long\\n      journey and the hair bristled unkempt from the wellshaped head\\n      it was a sorely stricken man who lay before us\\n\\n      what is it watson asked holmes\\n\\n      absolute exhaustionpossibly mere hunger and fatigue said i\\n      with my finger on the thready pulse where the stream of life\\n      trickled thin and small\\n\\n      return ticket from mackleton in the north of england said\\n      holmes drawing it from the watchpocket it is not twelve\\n      oclock yet he has certainly been an early starter\\n\\n      the puckered eyelids had begun to quiver and now a pair of\\n      vacant grey eyes looked up at us an instant later the man had\\n      scrambled on to his feet his face crimson with shame\\n\\n      forgive this weakness mr holmes i have been a little\\n      overwrought thank you if i might have a glass of milk and a\\n      biscuit i have no doubt that i should be better i came\\n      personally mr holmes in order to insure that you would return\\n      with me i feared that no telegram would convince you of the\\n      absolute urgency of the case\\n\\n      when you are quite restored\\n\\n      i am quite well again i cannot imagine how i came to be so\\n      weak i wish you mr holmes to come to mackleton with me by the\\n      next train\\n\\n      my friend shook his head\\n\\n      my colleague dr watson could tell you that we are very busy\\n      at present i am retained in this case of the ferrers documents\\n      and the abergavenny murder is coming up for trial only a very\\n      important issue could call me from london at present\\n\\n      important our visitor threw up his hands have you heard\\n      nothing of the abduction of the only son of the duke of\\n      holdernesse\\n\\n      what the late cabinet minister\\n\\n      exactly we had tried to keep it out of the papers but there\\n      was some rumour in the globe last night i thought it might\\n      have reached your ears\\n\\n      holmes shot out his long thin arm and picked out volume h in\\n      his encyclopdia of reference\\n\\n      holdernesse th duke kg pchalf the alphabet baron\\n      beverley earl of carstondear me what a list lord lieutenant\\n      of hallamshire since  married edith daughter of sir charles\\n      appledore  heir and only child

wales lord of the\\n      admiralty  chief secretary of state for well well this\\n      man is certainly one of the greatest subjects of the crown\\n\\n      the greatest and perhaps the wealthiest i am aware mr holmes\\n      that you take a very high line in professional matters and that\\n      you are prepared to work for the works sake i may tell you\\n      however that his grace has already intimated that a check for\\n      five thousand pounds will be handed over to the person who can\\n      tell him where his son is and another thousand to him who can\\n      name the man or men who have taken him\\n\\n      it is a princely offer said holmes watson i think that we\\n      shall accompany dr huxtable back to the north of england and\\n      now dr huxtable when you have consumed that milk you will\\n      kindly tell me what has happened when it happened how it\\n      happened and finally what dr thorneycroft huxtable of the\\n      priory school near mackleton has to do with the matter and why\\n      he comes three days after an eventthe state of your chin gives\\n      the dateto ask for my humble services\\n\\n      our visitor had consumed his milk and biscuits the light had\\n      come back to his eyes and the colour to his cheeks as he set\\n      himself with great vigour and lucidity to explain the situation\\n\\n      i must inform you gentlemen that the priory is a preparatory\\n      school of which i am the founder and principal huxtables\\n      sidelights on horace may possibly recall my name to your\\n      memories the priory is without exception the best and most\\n      select preparatory school in england lord leverstoke the earl\\n      of blackwater sir cathcart soamesthey all have intrusted their\\n      sons to me but i felt that my school had reached its zenith\\n      when weeks ago the duke of holdernesse sent mr james wilder\\n      his secretary with intimation that young lord saltire ten years\\n      old his only son and heir was about to be committed to my\\n      charge little did i think that this would be the prelude to the\\n      most crushing misfortune of my life\\n\\n      on may st the boy arrived that being the beginning of the\\n      summer term he was a charming youth and he soon fell into our\\n      ways i may tell youi trust that i am not indiscreet but\\n      halfconfidences are absurd in such a casethat he was not\\n      entirely happy at home it is an open secret that the dukes\\n      married life had not been a peaceful one and the matter had\\n      ended in a separation by mutual consent the duchess taking up\\n      her residence in the south of france this had occurred very\\n      shortly before and the boys sympathies are known to have been\\n      strongly with his mother he moped after her departure from\\n      holdernesse hall and it was for this reason that the duke\\n      desired to send him to my establishment in a fortnight the boy\\n      was quite at home with us and was apparently absolutely happy\\n\\n      he was last seen on the night of may ththat is the night of\\n      last monday his room was on the second floor and was approached\\n      through another larger room in which two boys were sleeping\\n      these boys saw and heard nothing so that it is certain that\\n      young saltire did not pass out that way his window was open and\\n      there is a stout ivy plant leading to the ground we could trace\\n      no footmarks below but it is sure that this is the only possible\\n      exit\\n\\n      his absence was discovered at seven oclock on tuesday morning\\n      his bed had been slept in he had dressed himself fully before\\n      going off in his usual school suit of black eton jacket and dark\\n      grey trousers there were no signs that anyone had entered the\\n      room and it is quite certain that anything in the nature of\\n      cries or a struggle would have been heard since caunter the\\n      elder boy in the inner room is a very light sleeper\\n\\n      when lord saltires disappearance was discovered i at once\\n      called a roll of the whole establishmentboys masters and\\n      servants it was then that we ascertained that lord saltire had\\n      not been alone in his flight heidegger the german master was\\n      missing his room was on the second floor at the farther end of\\n      the building facing the same way as lord saltires his bed had\\n      also been slept in but he had apparently gone away partly\\n      dressed since his shirt and socks were lying on the floor he\\n      had undoubtedly let himself down by the ivy for we could see the\\n      marks of his feet where he had landed on the lawn his bicycle\\n      was kept in a small shed beside this lawn and it also was gone\\n\\n      he had been with me for two years and came with the best\\n      references but he was a silent morose man not very popular\\n      either with masters or boys no trace could be found of the\\n      fugitives and now on thursday morning we are as ignorant as we\\n      were on tuesday inquiry was of course made at once at\\n      holdernesse hall it is only a few miles away and we imagined\\n      that in some sudden attack of homesickness he had gone back to\\n      his father but nothing had been heard of him the duke is\\n      greatly agitated and as to me you have seen yourselves the\\n      state of nervous prostration to which the suspense and the\\n      responsibility have reduced me mr holmes if ever you put\\n      forward your full powers i implore you to do so now for never\\n      in your life could you have a case which is more worthy of them\\n\\n      sherlock holmes had listened with the utmost intentness to the\\n      statement of the unhappy schoolmaster his drawn brows and the\\n      deep furrow between them showed that he needed no exhortation to\\n      concentrate all his attention upon a problem which apart from\\n      the tremendous interests involved must appeal so directly to his\\n      love of the complex and the unusual he now drew out his notebook\\n      and jotted down one or two memoranda\\n\\n      you have been very remiss in not coming to me sooner said he\\n      severely you start me on my investigation with a very serious\\n      handicap it is inconceivable for example that this ivy and\\n      this lawn would have yielded nothing to an expert observer\\n\\n      i am not to blame mr holmes his grace was extremely desirous\\n      to avoid all public scandal he was afraid of his family\\n      unhappiness being dragged before the world he has a deep horror\\n      of anything of the kind\\n\\n      but there has been some official investigation\\n\\n      yes sir and it has proved most disappointing an apparent clue\\n      was at once obtained since a boy and a young man were reported\\n      to have been seen leaving a neighbouring station by an early\\n      train only last night we had news that the couple had been\\n      hunted down in liverpool and they prove to have no connection\\n      whatever with the matter in hand then it was that in my despair\\n      and disappointment after a sleepless night i came straight to\\n      you by the early train\\n\\n      i suppose the local investigation was relaxed while this false\\n      clue was being followed up\\n\\n      it was entirely dropped\\n\\n      so that three days have been wasted the affair has been most\\n      deplorably handled\\n\\n      i feel it and admit it\\n\\n      and yet the problem should be capable of ultimate solution i\\n      shall be very happy to look into it have you been able to trace\\n      any connection between the missing boy and this german master\\n\\n      none at all\\n\\n      was he in the masters class\\n\\n      no he never exchanged a word with him so far as i know\\n\\n      that is certainly very singular had the boy a bicycle\\n\\n      no\\n\\n      was any other bicycle missing\\n\\n      no\\n\\n      is that certain\\n\\n      quite\\n\\n      well now you do not mean to seriously suggest that this german\\n      rode off upon a bicycle in the dead of the night bearing the boy\\n      in his arms\\n\\n      certainly not\\n\\n      then what is the theory in your mind\\n\\n      the bicycle may have been a blind it may have been hidden\\n      somewhere and the pair gone off on foot\\n\\n      quite so but it seems rather an absurd blind does it not were\\n      there other bicycles in this shed\\n\\n      several\\n\\n      would he not have hidden a couple had he desired to give the\\n      idea that they had gone off upon them\\n\\n      i suppose he would\\n\\n      of course he would the blind theory wont do but the incident\\n      is an admirable startingpoint for an investigation after all a\\n      bicycle is not an easy thing to conceal or to destroy one other\\n      question did anyone call to see the boy on the day before he\\n      disappeared\\n\\n      no\\n\\n      did he get any letters\\n\\n      yes one letter\\n\\n      from whom\\n\\n      from his father\\n\\n      do you open the boys letters\\n\\n      no\\n\\n      how do you know it was from the father\\n\\n      the coat of arms was on the envelope and it was addressed in\\n      the dukes peculiar stiff hand besides the duke remembers\\n      having written\\n\\n      when had he a letter before that\\n\\n      not for several days\\n\\n      had he ever one from france\\n\\n      no never\\n\\n      you see the point of my questions of course either the boy was\\n      carried off by force or he went of his own free will in the\\n      latter case you would expect that some prompting from outside\\n      would be needed to make so young a lad do such a thing if he has\\n      had no visitors that prompting must have come in letters hence\\n      i try to find out who were his correspondents\\n\\n      i fear i cannot help you much his only correspondent so far as\\n      i know was his own father\\n\\n      who wrote to him on the very day of his disappearance were the\\n      relations between father and son very friendly\\n\\n      his grace is never very friendly with anyone he is completely\\n      immersed in large public questions and is rather inaccessible to\\n      all ordinary emotions but he was always kind to the boy in his\\n      own way\\n\\n      but the sympathies of the latter were with the mother\\n\\n      yes\\n\\n      did he say so\\n\\n      no\\n\\n      the duke then\\n\\n      good heavens no\\n\\n      then how could you know\\n\\n      i have had some confidential talks with mr james wilder his\\n      graces secretary it was he who gave me the information about\\n      lord saltires feelings\\n\\n      i see by the way that last letter of the dukeswas it found\\n      in the boys room after he was gone\\n\\n      no he had taken it with him i think mr holmes it is time\\n      that we were leaving for euston\\n\\n      i will order a fourwheeler in a quarter of an hour we shall\\n      be at your service if you are telegraphing home mr huxtable\\n      it would be well to allow the people in your neighbourhood to\\n      imagine that the inquiry is still going on in liverpool or\\n      wherever else that red herring led your pack in the meantime i\\n      will do a little quiet work at your own doors and perhaps the\\n      scent is not so cold but that two old hounds like watson and\\n      myself may get a sniff of it\\n\\n      that evening found us in the cold bracing atmosphere of the peak\\n      country in which dr huxtables famous school is situated it\\n      was already dark when we reached it a card was lying on the hall\\n      table and the butler whispered something to his master who\\n      turned to us with agitation in every heavy feature\\n\\n      the duke is here said he the duke and mr wilder are in the\\n      study come gentlemen and i will introduce you\\n\\n      i was of course familiar with the pictures of the famous\\n      statesman but the man himself was very different from his\\n      representation he was a tall and stately person scrupulously\\n      dressed with a drawn thin face and a nose which was\\n      grotesquely curved and long his complexion was of a dead pallor\\n      which was more startling by contrast with a long dwindling beard\\n      of vivid red which flowed down over his white waistcoat with his\\n      watchchain gleaming through its fringe such was the stately\\n      presence who looked stonily at us from the centre of dr\\n      huxtables hearthrug beside him stood a very young man whom i\\n      understood to be wilder the private secretary he was small\\n      nervous alert with intelligent lightblue eyes and mobile\\n      features it was he who at once in an incisive and positive\\n      tone opened the conversation\\n\\n      i called this morning dr huxtable too late to prevent you\\n      from starting for london i learned that your object was to\\n      invite mr sherlock holmes to undertake the conduct of this case\\n      his grace is surprised dr huxtable that you should have taken\\n      such a step without consulting him\\n\\n      when i learned that the police had failed\\n\\n      his grace is by no means convinced that the police have failed\\n\\n      but surely mr wilder\\n\\n      you are well aware dr huxtable that his grace is particularly\\n      anxious to avoid all public scandal he prefers to take as few\\n      people as possible into his confidence\\n\\n      the matter can be easily remedied said the browbeaten doctor\\n      mr sherlock holmes can return to london by the morning train\\n\\n      hardly that doctor hardly that said holmes in his blandest\\n      voice this northern air is invigorating and pleasant so i\\n      propose to spend a few days upon your moors and to occupy my\\n      mind as best i may whether i have the shelter of your roof or of\\n      the village inn is of course for you to decide\\n\\n      i could see that the unfortunate doctor was in the last stage of\\n      indecision from which he was rescued by the deep sonorous voice\\n      of the redbearded duke which boomed out like a dinnergong\\n\\n      i agree with mr wilder dr huxtable that you would have done\\n      wisely to consult me but since mr holmes has already been taken\\n      into your confidence it would indeed be absurd that we should\\n      not avail ourselves of his services far from going to the inn\\n      mr holmes i should be pleased if you would come and stay with\\n      me at holdernesse hall\\n\\n      i thank your grace for the purposes of my investigation i\\n      think that it would be wiser for me to remain at the scene of the\\n      mystery\\n\\n      just as you like mr holmes any information which mr wilder\\n      or i can give you is of course at your disposal\\n\\n      it will probably be necessary for me to see you at the hall\\n      said holmes i would only ask you now sir whether you have\\n      formed any explanation in your own mind as to the mysterious\\n      disappearance of your son\\n\\n      no sir i have not\\n\\n      excuse me if i allude to that which is painful to you but i\\n      have no alternative do you think that the duchess had anything\\n      to do with the matter\\n\\n      the great minister showed perceptible hesitation\\n\\n      i do not think so he said at last\\n\\n      the other most obvious explanation is that the child has been\\n      kidnapped for the purpose of levying ransom you have not had any\\n      demand of the sort\\n\\n      no sir\\n\\n      one more question your grace i understand that you wrote to\\n      your son upon the day when this incident occurred\\n\\n      no i wrote upon the day before\\n\\n      exactly but he received it on that day\\n\\n      yes\\n\\n      was there anything in your letter which might have unbalanced\\n      him or induced him to take such a step\\n\\n      no sir certainly not\\n\\n      did you post that letter yourself\\n\\n      the noblemans reply was interrupted by his secretary who broke\\n      in with some heat\\n\\n      his grace is not in the habit of posting letters himself said\\n      he this letter was laid with others upon the study table and i\\n      myself put them in the postbag\\n\\n      you are sure this one was among them\\n\\n      yes i observed it\\n\\n      how many letters did your grace write that day\\n\\n      twenty or thirty i have a large correspondence but surely this\\n      is somewhat irrelevant\\n\\n      not entirely said holmes\\n\\n      for my own part the duke continued i have advised the police\\n      to turn their attention to the south of france i have already\\n      said that i do not believe that the duchess would encourage so\\n      monstrous an action but the lad had the most wrongheaded\\n      opinions and it is possible that he may have fled to her aided\\n      and abetted by this german i think dr huxtable that we will\\n      now return to the hall\\n\\n      i could see that there were other questions which holmes would\\n      have wished to put but the noblemans abrupt manner showed that\\n      the interview was at an end it was evident that to his intensely\\n      aristocratic nature this discussion of his intimate family\\n      affairs with a stranger was most abhorrent and that he feared\\n      lest every fresh question would throw a fiercer light into the\\n      discreetly shadowed corners of his ducal history\\n\\n      when the nobleman and his secretary had left my friend flung\\n      himself at once with characteristic eagerness into the\\n      investigation\\n\\n      the boys chamber was carefully examined and yielded nothing\\n      save the absolute conviction that it was only through the window\\n      that he could have escaped the german masters room and effects\\n      gave no further clue in his case a trailer of ivy had given way\\n      under his weight and we saw by the light of a lantern the mark\\n      on the lawn where his heels had come down that one dint in the\\n      short green grass was the only material witness left of this\\n      inexplicable nocturnal flight\\n\\n      sherlock holmes left the house alone and only returned after\\n      eleven he had obtained a large ordnance map of the\\n      neighbourhood and this he brought into my room where he laid it\\n      out on the bed and having balanced the lamp in the middle of\\n      it he began to smoke over it and occasionally to point out\\n      objects of interest with the reeking amber of his pipe\\n\\n      this case grows upon me watson said he there are decidedly\\n      some points of interest in connection with it in this early\\n      stage i want you to realize those geographical features which\\n      may have a good deal to do with our investigation\\n\\n      holmesmap\\n\\n      holmes map of the neighbourhood of the school\\n\\n      look at this map this dark square is the priory school ill\\n      put a pin in it now this line is the main road you see that it\\n      runs east and west past the school and you see also that there\\n      is no side road for a mile either way if these two folk passed\\n      away by road it was this road\\n\\n      exactly\\n\\n      by a singular and happy chance we are able to some extent to\\n      check what passed along this road during the night in question\\n      at this point where my pipe is now resting a county constable\\n      was on duty from twelve to six it is as you perceive the first\\n      crossroad on the east side this man declares that he was not\\n      absent from his post for an instant and he is positive that\\n      neither boy nor man could have gone that way unseen i have\\n      spoken with this policeman tonight and he appears to me to be a\\n      perfectly reliable person that blocks this end we have now to\\n      deal with the other there is an inn here the red bull the\\n      landlady of which was ill she had sent to mackleton for a\\n      doctor but he did not arrive until morning being absent at\\n      another case the people at the inn were alert all night\\n      awaiting his coming and one or other of them seems to have\\n      continually had an eye upon the road they declare that no one\\n      passed if their evidence is good then we are fortunate enough\\n      to be able to block the west and also to be able to say that the\\n      fugitives did not use the road at all\\n\\n      but the bicycle i objected\\n\\n      quite so we will come to the bicycle presently to continue our\\n      reasoning if these people did not go by the road they must have\\n      traversed the country to the north of the house or to the south\\n      of the house that is certain let us weigh the one against the\\n      other on the south of the house is as you perceive a large\\n      district of arable land cut up into small fields with stone\\n      walls between them there i admit that a bicycle is impossible\\n      we can dismiss the idea we turn to the country on the north\\n      here there lies a grove of trees marked as the ragged shaw\\n      and on the farther side stretches a great rolling moor lower\\n      gill moor extending for ten miles and sloping gradually upward\\n      here at one side of this wilderness is holdernesse hall ten\\n      miles by road but only six across the moor it is a peculiarly\\n      desolate plain a few moor farmers have small holdings where\\n      they rear sheep and cattle except these the plover and the\\n      curlew are the only inhabitants until you come to the\\n      chesterfield high road there is a church there you see a few\\n      cottages and an inn beyond that the hills become precipitous\\n      surely it is here to the north that our quest must lie\\n\\n      but the bicycle i persisted\\n\\n      well well said holmes impatiently a good cyclist does not\\n      need a high road the moor is intersected with paths and the\\n      moon was at the full halloa what is this\\n\\n      there was an agitated knock at the door and an instant\\n      afterwards dr huxtable was in the room in his hand he held a\\n      blue cricketcap with a white chevron on the peak\\n\\n      at last we have a clue he cried thank heaven at last we are\\n      on the dear boys track it is his cap\\n\\n      where was it found\\n\\n      in the van of the gipsies who camped on the moor they left on\\n      tuesday today the police traced them down and examined their\\n      caravan this was found\\n\\n      how do they account for it\\n\\n      they shuffled and liedsaid that they found it on the moor on\\n      tuesday morning they know where he is the rascals thank\\n      goodness they are all safe under lock and key either the fear\\n      of the law or the dukes purse will certainly get out of them all\\n      that they know\\n\\n      so far so good said holmes when the doctor had at last left\\n      the room it at least bears out the theory that it is on the\\n      side of the lower gill moor that we must hope for results the\\n      police have really done nothing locally save the arrest of these\\n      gipsies look here watson there is a watercourse across the\\n      moor you see it marked here in the map in some parts it widens\\n      into a morass this is particularly so in the region between\\n      holdernesse hall and the school it is vain to look elsewhere for\\n      tracks in this dry weather but at that point there is\\n      certainly a chance of some record being left i will call you\\n      early tomorrow morning and you and i will try if we can throw\\n      some little light upon the mystery\\n\\n      the day was just breaking when i woke to find the long thin form\\n      of holmes by my bedside he was fully dressed and had apparently\\n      already been out\\n\\n      i have done the lawn and the bicycle shed said he i have\\n      also had a rumble through the ragged shaw now watson there is\\n      cocoa ready in the next room i must beg you to hurry for we\\n      have a great day before us\\n\\n      his eyes shone and his cheek was flushed with the exhilaration\\n      of the master workman who sees his work lie ready before him a\\n      very different holmes this active alert man from the\\n      introspective and pallid dreamer of baker street i felt as i\\n      looked upon that supple figure alive with nervous energy that\\n      it was indeed a strenuous day that awaited us\\n\\n      and yet it opened in the blackest disappointment with high hopes\\n      we struck across the peaty russet moor intersected with a\\n      thousand sheep paths until we came to the broad lightgreen\\n      belt which marked the morass between us and holdernesse\\n      certainly if the lad had gone homeward he must have passed\\n      this and he could not pass it without leaving his traces but no\\n      sign of him or the german could be seen with a darkening face my\\n      friend strode along the margin eagerly observant of every muddy\\n      stain upon the mossy surface sheepmarks there were in\\n      profusion and at one place some miles down cows had left their\\n      tracks nothing more\\n\\n      check number one said holmes looking gloomily over the\\n      rolling expanse of the moor there is another morass down\\n      yonder and a narrow neck between halloa halloa halloa what\\n      have we here\\n\\n      we had come on a small black ribbon of pathway in the middle of\\n      it clearly marked on the sodden soil was the track of a\\n      bicycle\\n\\n      hurrah i cried we have it\\n\\n      but holmes was shaking his head and his face was puzzled and\\n      expectant rather than joyous\\n\\n      a bicycle certainly but not the bicycle said he i am\\n      familiar with fortytwo different impressions left by tires\\n      this as you perceive is a dunlop with a patch upon the outer\\n      cover heideggers tires were palmers leaving longitudinal\\n      stripes aveling the mathematical master was sure upon the\\n      point therefore it is not heideggers track\\n\\n      the boys then\\n\\n      possibly if we could prove a bicycle to have been in his\\n      possession but this we have utterly failed to do this track as\\n      you perceive was made by a rider who was going from the\\n      direction of the school\\n\\n      or towards it\\n\\n      no no my dear watson the more deeply sunk impression is of\\n      course the hind wheel upon which the weight rests you perceive\\n      several places where it has passed across and obliterated the\\n      more shallow mark of the front one it was undoubtedly heading\\n      away from the school it may or may not be connected with our\\n      inquiry but we will follow it backwards before we go any\\n      farther\\n\\n      we did so and at the end of a few hundred yards lost the tracks\\n      as we emerged from the boggy portion of the moor following the\\n      path backwards we picked out another spot where a spring\\n      trickled across it here once again was the mark of the\\n      bicycle though nearly obliterated by the hoofs of cows after\\n      that there was no sign but the path ran right on into ragged\\n      shaw the wood which backed on to the school from this wood the\\n      cycle must have emerged holmes sat down on a boulder and rested\\n      his chin in his hands i had smoked two cigarettes before he\\n      moved\\n\\n      well well said he at last it is of course possible that\\n      a cunning man might change the tires of his bicycle in order to\\n      leave unfamiliar tracks a criminal who was capable of such a\\n      thought is a man whom i should be proud to do business with we\\n      will leave this question undecided and hark back to our morass\\n      again for we have left a good deal unexplored\\n\\n      we continued our systematic survey of the edge of the sodden\\n      portion of the moor and soon our perseverance was gloriously\\n      rewarded right across the lower part of the bog lay a miry path\\n      holmes gave a cry of delight as he approached it an impression\\n      like a fine bundle of telegraph wires ran down the centre of it\\n      it was the palmer tires\\n\\n      here is herr heidegger sure enough cried holmes exultantly\\n      my reasoning seems to have been pretty sound watson\\n\\n      i congratulate you\\n\\n      but we have a long way still to go kindly walk clear of the\\n      path now let us follow the trail i fear that it will not lead\\n      very far\\n\\n      we found however as we advanced that this portion of the moor\\n      is intersected with soft patches and though we frequently lost\\n      sight of the track we always succeeded in picking it up once\\n      more\\n\\n      do you observe said holmes that the rider is now undoubtedly\\n      forcing the pace there can be no doubt of it look at this\\n      impression where you get both tires clear the one is as deep as\\n      the other that can only mean that the rider is throwing his\\n      weight on to the handlebar as a man does when he is sprinting\\n      by jove he has had a fall\\n\\n      there was a broad irregular smudge covering some yards of the\\n      track then there were a few footmarks and the tire reappeared\\n      once more\\n\\n      a sideslip i suggested\\n\\n      holmes held up a crumpled branch of flowering gorse to my horror\\n      i perceived that the yellow blossoms were all dabbled with\\n      crimson on the path too and among the heather were dark stains\\n      of clotted blood\\n\\n      bad said holmes bad stand clear watson not an unnecessary\\n      footstep what do i read here he fell woundedhe stood uphe\\n      remountedhe proceeded but there is no other track cattle on\\n      this side path he was surely not gored by a bull impossible\\n      but i see no traces of anyone else we must push on watson\\n      surely with stains as well as the track to guide us he cannot\\n      escape us now\\n\\n      our search was not a very long one the tracks of the tire began\\n      to curve fantastically upon the wet and shining path suddenly\\n      as i looked ahead the gleam of metal caught my eye from amid the\\n      thick gorsebushes out of them we dragged a bicycle\\n      palmertired one pedal bent and the whole front of it horribly\\n      smeared and slobbered with blood on the other side of the bushes\\n      a shoe was projecting we ran round and there lay the\\n      unfortunate rider he was a tall man fullbearded with\\n      spectacles one glass of which had been knocked out the cause of\\n      his death was a frightful blow upon the head which had crushed\\n      in part of his skull that he could have gone on after receiving\\n      such an injury said much for the vitality and courage of the man\\n      he wore shoes but no socks and his open coat disclosed a\\n      nightshirt beneath it it was undoubtedly the german master\\n\\n      holmes turned the body over reverently and examined it with\\n      great attention he then sat in deep thought for a time and i\\n      could see by his ruffled brow that this grim discovery had not\\n      in his opinion advanced us much in our inquiry\\n\\n      it is a little difficult to know what to do watson said he\\n      at last my own inclinations are to push this inquiry on for we\\n      have already lost so much time that we cannot afford to waste\\n      another hour on the other hand we are bound to inform the\\n      police of the discovery and to see that this poor fellows body\\n      is looked after\\n\\n      i could take a note back\\n\\n      but i need your company and assistance wait a bit there is a\\n      fellow cutting peat up yonder bring him over here and he will\\n      guide the police\\n\\n      i brought the peasant across and holmes dispatched the\\n      frightened man with a note to dr huxtable\\n\\n      now watson said he we have picked up two clues this\\n      morning one is the bicycle with the palmer tire and we see what\\n      that has led to the other is the bicycle with the patched\\n      dunlop before we start to investigate that let us try to\\n      realize what we do know so as to make the most of it and to\\n      separate the essential from the accidental\\n\\n      first of all i wish to impress upon you that the boy certainly\\n      left of his own freewill he got down from his window and he\\n      went off either alone or with someone that is sure\\n\\n      i assented\\n\\n      well now let us turn to this unfortunate german master the\\n      boy was fully dressed when he fled therefore he foresaw what he\\n      would do but the german went without his socks he certainly\\n      acted on very short notice\\n\\n      undoubtedly\\n\\n      why did he go because from his bedroom window he saw the\\n      flight of the boy because he wished to overtake him and bring\\n      him back he seized his bicycle pursued the lad and in pursuing\\n      him met his death\\n\\n      so it would seem\\n\\n      now i come to the critical part of my argument the natural\\n      action of a man in pursuing a little boy would be to run after\\n      him he would know that he could overtake him but the german\\n      does not do so he turns to his bicycle i am told that he was an\\n      excellent cyclist he would not do this if he did not see that\\n      the boy had some swift means of escape\\n\\n      the other bicycle\\n\\n      let us continue our reconstruction he meets his death five\\n      miles from the schoolnot by a bullet mark you which even a lad\\n      might conceivably discharge but by a savage blow dealt by a\\n      vigorous arm the lad then had a companion in his flight and\\n      the flight was a swift one since it took five miles before an\\n      expert cyclist could overtake them yet we survey the ground\\n      round the scene of the tragedy what do we find a few\\n      cattletracks nothing more i took a wide sweep round and there\\n      is no path within fifty yards another cyclist could have had\\n      nothing to do with the actual murder nor were there any human\\n      footmarks\\n\\n      holmes i cried this is impossible\\n\\n      admirable he said a most illuminating remark it is\\n      impossible as i state it and therefore i must in some respect\\n      have stated it wrong yet you saw for yourself can you suggest\\n      any fallacy\\n\\n      he could not have fractured his skull in a fall\\n\\n      in a morass watson\\n\\n      i am at my wits end\\n\\n      tut tut we have solved some worse problems at least we have\\n      plenty of material if we can only use it come then and\\n      having exhausted the palmer let us see what the dunlop with the\\n      patched cover has to offer us\\n\\n      we picked up the track and followed it onward for some distance\\n      but soon the moor rose into a long heathertufted curve and we\\n      left the watercourse behind us no further help from tracks could\\n      be hoped for at the spot where we saw the last of the dunlop\\n      tire it might equally have led to holdernesse hall the stately\\n      towers of which rose some miles to our left or to a low grey\\n      village which lay in front of us and marked the position of the\\n      chesterfield high road\\n\\n      as we approached the forbidding and squalid inn with the sign of\\n      a gamecock above the door holmes gave a sudden groan and\\n      clutched me by the shoulder to save himself from falling he had\\n      had one of those violent strains of the ankle which leave a man\\n      helpless with difficulty he limped up to the door where a\\n      squat dark elderly man was smoking a black clay pipe\\n\\n      how are you mr reuben hayes said holmes\\n\\n      who are you and how do you get my name so pat the countryman\\n      answered with a suspicious flash of a pair of cunning eyes\\n\\n      well its printed on the board above your head its easy to\\n      see a man who is master of his own house i suppose you havent\\n      such a thing as a carriage in your stables\\n\\n      no i have not\\n\\n      i can hardly put my foot to the ground\\n\\n      dont put it to the ground\\n\\n      but i cant walk\\n\\n      well then hop\\n\\n      mr reuben hayess manner was far from gracious but holmes took\\n      it with admirable goodhumour\\n\\n      look here my man said he this is really rather an awkward\\n      fix for me i dont mind how i get on\\n\\n      neither do i said the morose landlord\\n\\n      the matter is very important i would offer you a sovereign for\\n      the use of a bicycle\\n\\n      the landlord pricked up his ears\\n\\n      where do you want to go\\n\\n      to holdernesse hall\\n\\n      pals of the dook i suppose said the landlord surveying our\\n      mudstained garments with ironical eyes\\n\\n      holmes laughed goodnaturedly\\n\\n      hell be glad to see us anyhow\\n\\n      why\\n\\n      because we bring him news of his lost son\\n\\n      the landlord gave a very visible start\\n\\n      what youre on his track\\n\\n      he has been heard of in liverpool they expect to get him every\\n      hour\\n\\n      again a swift change passed over the heavy unshaven face his\\n      manner was suddenly genial\\n\\n      ive less reason to wish the dook well than most men said he\\n      for i was head coachman once and cruel bad he treated me it\\n      was him that sacked me without a character on the word of a lying\\n      cornchandler but im glad to hear that the young lord was heard\\n      of in liverpool and ill help you to take the news to the hall\\n\\n      thank you said holmes well have some food first then you\\n      can bring round the bicycle\\n\\n      i havent got a bicycle\\n\\n      holmes held up a sovereign\\n\\n      i tell you man that i havent got one ill let you have two\\n      horses as far as the hall\\n\\n      well well said holmes well talk about it when weve had\\n      something to eat\\n\\n      when we were left alone in the stoneflagged kitchen it was\\n      astonishing how rapidly that sprained ankle recovered it was\\n      nearly nightfall and we had eaten nothing since early morning\\n      so that we spent some time over our meal holmes was lost in\\n      thought and once or twice he walked over to the window and\\n      stared earnestly out it opened on to a squalid courtyard in the\\n      far corner was a smithy where a grimy lad was at work on the\\n      other side were the stables holmes had sat down again after one\\n      of these excursions when he suddenly sprang out of his chair\\n      with a loud exclamation\\n\\n      by heaven watson i believe that ive got it he cried yes\\n      yes it must be so watson do you remember seeing any cowtracks\\n      today\\n\\n      yes several\\n\\n      where\\n\\n      well everywhere they were at the morass and again on the\\n      path and again near where poor heidegger met his death\\n\\n      exactly well now watson how many cows did you see on the\\n      moor\\n\\n      i dont remember seeing any\\n\\n      strange watson that we should see tracks all along our line\\n      but never a cow on the whole moor very strange watson eh\\n\\n      yes it is strange\\n\\n      now watson make an effort throw your mind back can you see\\n      those tracks upon the path\\n\\n      yes i can\\n\\n      can you recall that the tracks were sometimes like that\\n      watsonhe arranged a number of breadcrumbs in this fashion \\n        and sometimes like this       and occasionally\\n      like this can you remember that\\n\\n      no i cannot\\n\\n      but i can i could swear to it however we will go back at our\\n      leisure and verify it what a blind beetle i have been not to\\n      draw my conclusion\\n\\n      and what is your conclusion\\n\\n      only that it is a remarkable cow which walks canters and\\n      gallops by george watson it was no brain of a country publican\\n      that thought out such a blind as that the coast seems to be\\n      clear save for that lad in the smithy let us slip out and see\\n      what we can see\\n\\n      there were two roughhaired unkempt horses in the tumbledown\\n      stable holmes raised the hind leg of one of them and laughed\\n      aloud\\n\\n      old shoes but newly shodold shoes but new nails this case\\n      deserves to be a classic let us go across to the smithy\\n\\n      the lad continued his work without regarding us i saw holmess\\n      eye darting to right and left among the litter of iron and wood\\n      which was scattered about the floor suddenly however we heard\\n      a step behind us and there was the landlord his heavy eyebrows\\n      drawn over his savage eyes his swarthy features convulsed with\\n      passion he held a short metalheaded stick in his hand and he\\n      advanced in so menacing a fashion that i was right glad to feel\\n      the revolver in my pocket\\n\\n      you infernal spies the man cried what are you doing there\\n\\n      why mr reuben hayes said holmes coolly one might think\\n      that you were afraid of our finding something out\\n\\n      the man mastered himself with a violent effort and his grim\\n      mouth loosened into a false laugh which was more menacing than\\n      his frown\\n\\n      youre welcome to all you can find out in my smithy said he\\n      but look here mister i dont care for folk poking about my\\n      place without my leave so the sooner you pay your score and get\\n      out of this the better i shall be pleased\\n\\n      all right mr hayes no harm meant said holmes we have been\\n      having a look at your horses but i think ill walk after all\\n      its not far i believe\\n\\n      not more than two miles to the hall gates thats the road to\\n      the left he watched us with sullen eyes until we had left his\\n      premises\\n\\n      we did not go very far along the road for holmes stopped the\\n      instant that the curve hid us from the landlords view\\n\\n      we were warm as the children say at that inn said he i\\n      seem to grow colder every step that i take away from it no no\\n      i cant possibly leave it\\n\\n      i am convinced said i that this reuben hayes knows all about\\n      it a more selfevident villain i never saw\\n\\n      oh he impressed you in that way did he there are the horses\\n      there is the smithy yes it is an interesting place this\\n      fighting cock i think we shall have another look at it in an\\n      unobtrusive way\\n\\n      a long sloping hillside dotted with grey limestone boulders\\n      stretched behind us we had turned off the road and were making\\n      our way up the hill when looking in the direction of\\n      holdernesse hall i saw a cyclist coming swiftly along\\n\\n      get down watson cried holmes with a heavy hand upon my\\n      shoulder we had hardly sunk from view when the man flew past us\\n      on the road amid a rolling cloud of dust i caught a glimpse of\\n      a pale agitated facea face with horror in every lineament the\\n      mouth open the eyes staring wildly in front it was like some\\n      strange caricature of the dapper james wilder whom we had seen\\n      the night before\\n\\n      the dukes secretary cried holmes come watson let us see\\n      what he does\\n\\n      we scrambled from rock to rock until in a few moments we had\\n      made our way to a point from which we could see the front door of\\n      the inn wilders bicycle was leaning against the wall beside it\\n      no one was moving about the house nor could we catch a glimpse\\n      of any faces at the windows slowly the twilight crept down as\\n      the sun sank behind the high towers of holdernesse hall then in\\n      the gloom we saw the two sidelamps of a trap light up in the\\n      stableyard of the inn and shortly afterwards heard the rattle\\n      of hoofs as it wheeled out into the road and tore off at a\\n      furious pace in the direction of chesterfield\\n\\n      what do you make of that watson holmes whispered\\n\\n      it looks like a flight\\n\\n      a single man in a dogcart so far as i could see well it\\n      certainly was not mr james wilder for there he is at the door\\n\\n      a red square of light had sprung out of the darkness in the\\n      middle of it was the black figure of the secretary his head\\n      advanced peering out into the night it was evident that he was\\n      expecting someone then at last there were steps in the road a\\n      second figure was visible for an instant against the light the\\n      door shut and all was black once more five minutes later a lamp\\n      was lit in a room upon the first floor\\n\\n      it seems to be a curious class of custom that is done by the\\n      fighting cock said holmes\\n\\n      the bar is on the other side\\n\\n      quite so these are what one may call the private guests now\\n      what in the world is mr james wilder doing in that den at this\\n      hour of night and who is the companion who comes to meet him\\n      there come watson we must really take a risk and try to\\n      investigate this a little more closely\\n\\n      together we stole down to the road and crept across to the door\\n      of the inn the bicycle still leaned against the wall holmes\\n      struck a match and held it to the back wheel and i heard him\\n      chuckle as the light fell upon a patched dunlop tire up above us\\n      was the lighted window\\n\\n      i must have a peep through that watson if you bend your back\\n      and support yourself upon the wall i think that i can manage\\n\\n      an instant later his feet were on my shoulders but he was\\n      hardly up before he was down again\\n\\n      come my friend said he our days work has been quite long\\n      enough i think that we have gathered all that we can its a\\n      long walk to the school and the sooner we get started the\\n      better\\n\\n      he hardly opened his lips during that weary trudge across the\\n      moor nor would he enter the school when he reached it but went\\n      on to mackleton station whence he could send some telegrams\\n      late at night i heard him consoling dr huxtable prostrated by\\n      the tragedy of his masters death and later still he entered my\\n      room as alert and vigorous as he had been when he started in the\\n      morning all goes well my friend said he i promise that\\n      before tomorrow evening we shall have reached the solution of\\n      the mystery\\n\\n      at eleven oclock next morning my friend and i were walking up\\n      the famous yew avenue of holdernesse hall we were ushered\\n      through the magnificent elizabethan doorway and into his graces\\n      study there we found mr james wilder demure and courtly but\\n      with some trace of that wild terror of the night before still\\n      lurking in his furtive eyes and in his twitching features\\n\\n      you have come to see his grace i am sorry but the fact is that\\n      the duke is far from well he has been very much upset by the\\n      tragic news we received a telegram from dr huxtable yesterday\\n      afternoon which told us of your discovery\\n\\n      i must see the duke mr wilder\\n\\n      but he is in his room\\n\\n      then i must go to his room\\n\\n      i believe he is in his bed\\n\\n      i will see him there\\n\\n      holmess cold and inexorable manner showed the secretary that it\\n      was useless to argue with him\\n\\n      very good mr holmes i will tell him that you are here\\n\\n      after an hours delay the great nobleman appeared his face was\\n      more cadaverous than ever his shoulders had rounded and he\\n      seemed to me to be an altogether older man than he had been the\\n      morning before he greeted us with a stately courtesy and seated\\n      himself at his desk his red beard streaming down on the table\\n\\n      well mr holmes said he\\n\\n      but my friends eyes were fixed upon the secretary who stood by\\n      his masters chair\\n\\n      i think your grace that i could speak more freely in mr\\n      wilders absence\\n\\n      the man turned a shade paler and cast a malignant glance at\\n      holmes\\n\\n      if your grace wishes\\n\\n      yes yes you had better go now mr holmes what have you to\\n      say\\n\\n      my friend waited until the door had closed behind the retreating\\n      secretary\\n\\n      the fact is your grace said he that my colleague dr\\n      watson and myself had an assurance from dr huxtable that a\\n      reward had been offered in this case i should like to have this\\n      confirmed from your own lips\\n\\n      certainly mr holmes\\n\\n      it amounted if i am correctly informed to five thousand pounds\\n      to anyone who will tell you where your son is\\n\\n      exactly\\n\\n      and another thousand to the man who will name the person or\\n      persons who keep him in custody\\n\\n      exactly\\n\\n      under the latter heading is included no doubt not only those\\n      who may have taken him away but also those who conspire to keep\\n      him in his present position\\n\\n      yes yes cried the duke impatiently if you do your work\\n      well mr sherlock holmes you will have no reason to complain of\\n      niggardly treatment\\n\\n      my friend rubbed his thin hands together with an appearance of\\n      avidity which was a surprise to me who knew his frugal tastes\\n\\n      i fancy that i see your graces checkbook upon the table said\\n      he i should be glad if you would make me out a check for six\\n      thousand pounds it would be as well perhaps for you to cross\\n      it the capital and counties bank oxford street branch are my\\n      agents\\n\\n      his grace sat very stern and upright in his chair and looked\\n      stonily at my friend\\n\\n      is this a joke mr holmes it is hardly a subject for\\n      pleasantry\\n\\n      not at all your grace i was never more earnest in my life\\n\\n      what do you mean then\\n\\n      i mean that i have earned the reward i know where your son is\\n      and i know some at least of those who are holding him\\n\\n      the dukes beard had turned more aggressively red than ever\\n      against his ghastly white face\\n\\n      where is he he gasped\\n\\n      he is or was last night at the fighting cock inn about two\\n      miles from your park gate\\n\\n      the duke fell back in his chair\\n\\n      and whom do you accuse\\n\\n      sherlock holmess answer was an astounding one he stepped\\n      swiftly forward and touched the duke upon the shoulder\\n\\n      i accuse you said he and now your grace ill trouble you\\n      for that check\\n\\n      never shall i forget the dukes appearance as he sprang up and\\n      clawed with his hands like one who is sinking into an abyss\\n      then with an extraordinary effort of aristocratic selfcommand\\n      he sat down and sank his face in his hands it was some minutes\\n      before he spoke\\n\\n      how much do you know he asked at last without raising his\\n      head\\n\\n      i saw you together last night\\n\\n      does anyone else beside your friend know\\n\\n      i have spoken to no one\\n\\n      the duke took a pen in his quivering fingers and opened his\\n      checkbook\\n\\n      i shall be as good as my word mr holmes i am about to write\\n      your check however unwelcome the information which you have\\n      gained may be to me when the offer was first made i little\\n      thought the turn which events might take but you and your friend\\n      are men of discretion mr holmes\\n\\n      i hardly understand your grace\\n\\n      i must put it plainly mr holmes if only you two know of this\\n      incident there is no reason why it should go any farther i\\n      think twelve thousand pounds is the sum that i owe you is it\\n      not\\n\\n      but holmes smiled and shook his head\\n\\n      i fear your grace that matters can hardly be arranged so\\n      easily there is the death of this schoolmaster to be accounted\\n      for\\n\\n      but james knew nothing of that you cannot hold him responsible\\n      for that it was the work of this brutal ruffian whom he had the\\n      misfortune to employ\\n\\n      i must take the view your grace that when a man embarks upon a\\n      crime he is morally guilty of any other crime which may spring\\n      from it\\n\\n      morally mr holmes no doubt you are right but surely not in\\n      the eyes of the law a man cannot be condemned for a murder at\\n      which he was not present and which he loathes and abhors as much\\n      as you do the instant that he heard of it he made a complete\\n      confession to me so filled was he with horror and remorse he\\n      lost not an hour in breaking entirely with the murderer oh mr\\n      holmes you must save himyou must save him i tell you that you\\n      must save him the duke had dropped the last attempt at\\n      selfcommand and was pacing the room with a convulsed face and\\n      with his clenched hands raving in the air at last he mastered\\n      himself and sat down once more at his desk i appreciate your\\n      conduct in coming here before you spoke to anyone else said he\\n      at least we may take counsel how far we can minimize this\\n      hideous scandal\\n\\n      exactly said holmes i think your grace that this can only\\n      be done by absolute frankness between us i am disposed to help\\n      your grace to the best of my ability but in order to do so i\\n      must understand to the last detail how the matter stands i\\n      realize that your words applied to mr james wilder and that he\\n      is not the murderer\\n\\n      no the murderer has escaped\\n\\n      sherlock holmes smiled demurely\\n\\n      your grace can hardly have heard of any small reputation which i\\n      possess or you would not imagine that it is so easy to escape\\n      me mr reuben hayes was arrested at chesterfield on my\\n      information at eleven oclock last night i had a telegram from\\n      the head of the local police before i left the school this\\n      morning\\n\\n      the duke leaned back in his chair and stared with amazement at my\\n      friend\\n\\n      you seem to have powers that are hardly human said he so\\n      reuben hayes is taken i am right glad to hear it if it will not\\n      react upon the fate of james\\n\\n      your secretary\\n\\n      no sir my son\\n\\n      it was holmess turn to look astonished\\n\\n      i confess that this is entirely new to me your grace i must\\n      beg you to be more explicit\\n\\n      i will conceal nothing from you i agree with you that complete\\n      frankness however painful it may be to me is the best policy in\\n      this desperate situation to which jamess folly and jealousy have\\n      reduced us when i was a very young man mr holmes i loved with\\n      such a love as comes only once in a lifetime i offered the lady\\n      marriage but she refused it on the grounds that such a match\\n      might mar my career had she lived i would certainly never have\\n      married anyone else she died and left this one child whom for\\n      her sake i have cherished and cared for i could not acknowledge\\n      the paternity to the world but i gave him the best of\\n      educations and since he came to manhood i have kept him near my\\n      person he surmised my secret and has presumed ever since upon\\n      the claim which he has upon me and upon his power of provoking a\\n      scandal which would be abhorrent to me his presence had\\n      something to do with the unhappy issue of my marriage above all\\n      he hated my young legitimate heir from the first with a\\n      persistent hatred you may well ask me why under these\\n      circumstances i still kept james under my roof i answer that it\\n      was because i could see his mothers face in his and that for\\n      her dear sake there was no end to my longsuffering all her\\n      pretty ways toothere was not one of them which he could not\\n      suggest and bring back to my memory i could not send him away\\n      but i feared so much lest he should do arthurthat is lord\\n      saltirea mischief that i dispatched him for safety to dr\\n      huxtables school\\n\\n      james came into contact with this fellow hayes because the man\\n      was a tenant of mine and james acted as agent the fellow was a\\n      rascal from the beginning but in some extraordinary way james\\n      became intimate with him he had always a taste for low company\\n      when james determined to kidnap lord saltire it was of this\\n      mans service that he availed himself you remember that i wrote\\n      to arthur upon that last day well james opened the letter and\\n      inserted a note asking arthur to meet him in a little wood called\\n      the ragged shaw which is near to the school he used the\\n      duchesss name and in that way got the boy to come that evening\\n      james bicycled overi am telling you what he has himself\\n      confessed to meand he told arthur whom he met in the wood that\\n      his mother longed to see him that she was awaiting him on the\\n      moor and that if he would come back into the wood at midnight he\\n      would find a man with a horse who would take him to her poor\\n      arthur fell into the trap he came to the appointment and found\\n      this fellow hayes with a led pony arthur mounted and they set\\n      off together it appearsthough this james only heard\\n      yesterdaythat they were pursued that hayes struck the pursuer\\n      with his stick and that the man died of his injuries hayes\\n      brought arthur to his publichouse the fighting cock where he\\n      was confined in an upper room under the care of mrs hayes who\\n      is a kindly woman but entirely under the control of her brutal\\n      husband\\n\\n      well mr holmes that was the state of affairs when i first saw\\n      you two days ago i had no more idea of the truth than you you\\n      will ask me what was jamess motive in doing such a deed i\\n      answer that there was a great deal which was unreasoning and\\n      fanatical in the hatred which he bore my heir in his view he\\n      should himself have been heir of all my estates and he deeply\\n      resented those social laws which made it impossible at the same\\n      time he had a definite motive also he was eager that i should\\n      break the entail and he was of opinion that it lay in my power\\n      to do so he intended to make a bargain with meto restore arthur\\n      if i would break the entail and so make it possible for the\\n      estate to be left to him by will he knew well that i should\\n      never willingly invoke the aid of the police against him i say\\n      that he would have proposed such a bargain to me but he did not\\n      actually do so for events moved too quickly for him and he had\\n      not time to put his plans into practice\\n\\n      what brought all his wicked scheme to wreck was your discovery\\n      of this man heideggers dead body james was seized with horror\\n      at the news it came to us yesterday as we sat together in this\\n      study dr huxtable had sent a telegram james was so overwhelmed\\n      with grief and agitation that my suspicions which had never been\\n      entirely absent rose instantly to a certainty and i taxed him\\n      with the deed he made a complete voluntary confession then he\\n      implored me to keep his secret for three days longer so as to\\n      give his wretched accomplice a chance of saving his guilty life\\n      i yieldedas i have always yieldedto his prayers and instantly\\n      james hurried off to the fighting cock to warn hayes and give him\\n      the means of flight i could not go there by daylight without\\n      provoking comment but as soon as night fell i hurried off to see\\n      my dear arthur i found him safe and well but horrified beyond\\n      expression by the dreadful deed he had witnessed in deference to\\n      my promise and much against my will i consented to leave him\\n      there for three days under the charge of mrs hayes since it\\n      was evident that it was impossible to inform the police where he\\n      was without telling them also who was the murderer and i could\\n      not see how that murderer could be punished without ruin to my\\n      unfortunate james you asked for frankness mr holmes and i\\n      have taken you at your word for i have now told you everything\\n      without an attempt at circumlocution or concealment do you in\\n      turn be as frank with me\\n\\n      i will said holmes in the first place your grace i am\\n      bound to tell you that you have placed yourself in a most serious\\n      position in the eyes of the law you have condoned a felony and\\n      you have aided the escape of a murderer for i cannot doubt that\\n      any money which was taken by james wilder to aid his accomplice\\n      in his flight came from your graces purse\\n\\n      the duke bowed his assent\\n\\n      this is indeed a most serious matter even more culpable in my\\n      opinion your grace is your attitude towards your younger son\\n      you leave him in this den for three days\\n\\n      under solemn promises\\n\\n      what are promises to such people as these you have no guarantee\\n      that he will not be spirited away again to humour your guilty\\n      elder son you have exposed your innocent younger son to imminent\\n      and unnecessary danger it was a most unjustifiable action\\n\\n      the proud lord of holdernesse was not accustomed to be so rated\\n      in his own ducal hall the blood flushed into his high forehead\\n      but his conscience held him dumb\\n\\n      i will help you but on one condition only it is that you ring\\n      for the footman and let me give such orders as i like\\n\\n      without a word the duke pressed the electric bell a servant\\n      entered\\n\\n      you will be glad to hear said holmes that your young master\\n      is found it is the dukes desire that the carriage shall go at\\n      once to the fighting cock inn to bring lord saltire home\\n\\n      now said holmes when the rejoicing lackey had disappeared\\n      having secured the future we can afford to be more lenient with\\n      the past i am not in an official position and there is no\\n      reason so long as the ends of justice are served why i should\\n      disclose all that i know as to hayes i say nothing the gallows\\n      awaits him and i would do nothing to save him from it what he\\n      will divulge i cannot tell but i have no doubt that your grace\\n      could make him understand that it is to his interest to be\\n      silent from the police point of view he will have kidnapped the\\n      boy for the purpose of ransom if they do not themselves find it\\n      out i see no reason why i should prompt them to take a broader\\n      point of view i would warn your grace however that the\\n      continued presence of mr james wilder in your household can only\\n      lead to misfortune\\n\\n      i understand that mr holmes and it is already settled that he\\n      shall leave me forever and go to seek his fortune in australia\\n\\n      in that case your grace since you have yourself stated that\\n      any unhappiness in your married life was caused by his presence i\\n      would suggest that you make such amends as you can to the\\n      duchess and that you try to resume those relations which have\\n      been so unhappily interrupted\\n\\n      that also i have arranged mr holmes i wrote to the duchess\\n      this morning\\n\\n      in that case said holmes rising i think that my friend and\\n      i can congratulate ourselves upon several most happy results from\\n      our little visit to the north there is one other small point\\n      upon which i desire some light this fellow hayes had shod his\\n      horses with shoes which counterfeited the tracks of cows was it\\n      from mr wilder that he learned so extraordinary a device\\n\\n      the duke stood in thought for a moment with a look of intense\\n      surprise on his face then he opened a door and showed us into a\\n      large room furnished as a museum he led the way to a glass case\\n      in a corner and pointed to the inscription\\n\\n      these shoes it ran were dug up in the moat of holdernesse\\n      hall they are for the use of horses but they are shaped below\\n      with a cloven foot of iron so as to throw pursuers off the\\n      track they are supposed to have belonged to some of the\\n      marauding barons of holdernesse in the middle ages\\n\\n      holmes opened the case and moistening his finger he passed it\\n      along the shoe a thin film of recent mud was left upon his skin\\n\\n      thank you said he as he replaced the glass it is the second\\n      most interesting object that i have seen in the north\\n\\n      and the first\\n\\n      holmes folded up his check and placed it carefully in his\\n      notebook i am a poor man said he as he patted it\\n      affectionately and thrust it into the depths of his inner\\n      pocket\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe adventure of black peter\\n\\n\\n      i have never known my friend to be in better form both mental\\n      and physical than in the year  his increasing fame had\\n      brought with it an immense practice and i should be guilty of an\\n      indiscretion if i were even to hint at the identity of some of\\n      the illustrious clients who crossed our humble threshold in baker\\n      street holmes however like all great artists lived for his\\n      arts sake and save in the case of the duke of holdernesse i\\n      have seldom known him claim any large reward for his inestimable\\n      services so unworldly was heor so capriciousthat he frequently\\n      refused his help to the powerful and wealthy where the problem\\n      made no appeal to his sympathies while he would devote weeks of\\n      most intense application to the affairs of some humble client\\n      whose case presented those strange and dramatic qualities which\\n      appealed to his imagination and challenged his ingenuity\\n\\n      in this memorable year  a curious and incongruous succession\\n      of cases had engaged his attention ranging from his famous\\n      investigation of the sudden death of cardinal toscaan inquiry\\n      which was carried out by him at the express desire of his\\n      holiness the popedown to his arrest of wilson the notorious\\n      canarytrainer which removed a plaguespot from the east end of\\n      london close on the heels of these two famous cases came the\\n      tragedy of woodmans lee and the very obscure circumstances\\n      which surrounded the death of captain peter carey no record of\\n      the doings of mr sherlock holmes would be complete which did not\\n      include some account of this very unusual affair\\n\\n      during the first week of july my friend had been absent so often\\n      and so long from our lodgings that i knew he had something on\\n      hand the fact that several roughlooking men called during that\\n      time and inquired for captain basil made me understand that\\n      holmes was working somewhere under one of the numerous disguises\\n      and names with which he concealed his own formidable identity he\\n      had at least five small refuges in different parts of london in\\n      which he was able to change his personality he said nothing of\\n      his business to me and it was not my habit to force a\\n      confidence the first positive sign which he gave me of the\\n      direction which his investigation was taking was an extraordinary\\n      one he had gone out before breakfast and i had sat down to mine\\n      when he strode into the room his hat upon his head and a huge\\n      barbedheaded spear tucked like an umbrella under his arm\\n\\n      good gracious holmes i cried you dont mean to say that you\\n      have been walking about london with that thing\\n\\n      i drove to the butchers and back\\n\\n      the butchers\\n\\n      and i return with an excellent appetite there can be no\\n      question my dear watson of the value of exercise before\\n      breakfast but i am prepared to bet that you will not guess the\\n      form that my exercise has taken\\n\\n      i will not attempt it\\n\\n      he chuckled as he poured out the coffee\\n\\n      if you could have looked into allardyces back shop you would\\n      have seen a dead pig swung from a hook in the ceiling and a\\n      gentleman in his shirt sleeves furiously stabbing at it with this\\n      weapon i was that energetic person and i have satisfied myself\\n      that by no exertion of my strength can i transfix the pig with a\\n      single blow perhaps you would care to try\\n\\n      not for worlds but why were you doing this\\n\\n      because it seemed to me to have an indirect bearing upon the\\n      mystery of woodmans lee ah hopkins i got your wire last\\n      night and i have been expecting you come and join us\\n\\n      our visitor was an exceedingly alert man thirty years of age\\n      dressed in a quiet tweed suit but retaining the erect bearing of\\n      one who was accustomed to official uniform i recognized him at\\n      once as stanley hopkins a young police inspector for whose\\n      future holmes had high hopes while he in turn professed the\\n      admiration and respect of a pupil for the scientific methods of\\n      the famous amateur hopkinss brow was clouded and he sat down\\n      with an air of deep dejection\\n\\n      no thank you sir i breakfasted before i came round i spent\\n      the night in town for i came up yesterday to report\\n\\n      and what had you to report\\n\\n      failure sir absolute failure\\n\\n      you have made no progress\\n\\n      none\\n\\n      dear me i must have a look at the matter\\n\\n      i wish to heavens that you would mr holmes its my first big\\n      chance and i am at my wits end for goodness sake come down\\n      and lend me a hand\\n\\n      well well it just happens that i have already read all the\\n      available evidence including the report of the inquest with\\n      some care by the way what do you make of that tobacco pouch\\n      found on the scene of the crime is there no clue there\\n\\n      hopkins looked surprised\\n\\n      it was the mans own pouch sir his initials were inside it\\n      and it was of sealskinand he was an old sealer\\n\\n      but he had no pipe\\n\\n      no sir we could find no pipe indeed he smoked very little\\n      and yet he might have kept some tobacco for his friends\\n\\n      no doubt i only mention it because if i had been handling the\\n      case i should have been inclined to make that the startingpoint\\n      of my investigation however my friend dr watson knows\\n      nothing of this matter and i should be none the worse for\\n      hearing the sequence of events once more just give us some short\\n      sketches of the essentials\\n\\n      stanley hopkins drew a slip of paper from his pocket\\n\\n      i have a few dates here which will give you the career of the\\n      dead man captain peter carey he was born in fifty years of\\n      age he was a most daring and successful seal and whale fisher\\n      in  he commanded the steam sealer sea unicorn of dundee\\n      he had then had several successful voyages in succession and in\\n      the following year  he retired after that he travelled for\\n      some years and finally he bought a small place called woodmans\\n      lee near forest row in sussex there he has lived for six\\n      years and there he died just a week ago today\\n\\n      there were some most singular points about the man in ordinary\\n      life he was a strict puritana silent gloomy fellow his\\n      household consisted of his wife his daughter aged twenty and\\n      two female servants these last were continually changing for it\\n      was never a very cheery situation and sometimes it became past\\n      all bearing the man was an intermittent drunkard and when he\\n      had the fit on him he was a perfect fiend he has been known to\\n      drive his wife and daughter out of doors in the middle of the\\n      night and flog them through the park until the whole village\\n      outside the gates was aroused by their screams\\n\\n      he was summoned once for a savage assault upon the old vicar\\n      who had called upon him to remonstrate with him upon his conduct\\n      in short mr holmes you would go far before you found a more\\n      dangerous man than peter carey and i have heard that he bore the\\n      same character when he commanded his ship he was known in the\\n      trade as black peter and the name was given him not only on\\n      account of his swarthy features and the colour of his huge beard\\n      but for the humours which were the terror of all around him i\\n      need not say that he was loathed and avoided by every one of his\\n      neighbours and that i have not heard one single word of sorrow\\n      about his terrible end\\n\\n      you must have read in the account of the inquest about the mans\\n      cabin mr holmes but perhaps your friend here has not heard of\\n      it he had built himself a wooden outhousehe always called it\\n      the cabina few hundred yards from his house and it was here\\n      that he slept every night it was a little singleroomed hut\\n      sixteen feet by ten he kept the key in his pocket made his own\\n      bed cleaned it himself and allowed no other foot to cross the\\n      threshold there are small windows on each side which were\\n      covered by curtains and never opened one of these windows was\\n      turned towards the high road and when the light burned in it at\\n      night the folk used to point it out to each other and wonder what\\n      black peter was doing in there thats the window mr holmes\\n      which gave us one of the few bits of positive evidence that came\\n      out at the inquest\\n\\n      you remember that a stonemason named slater walking from\\n      forest row about one oclock in the morningtwo days before the\\n      murderstopped as he passed the grounds and looked at the square\\n      of light still shining among the trees he swears that the shadow\\n      of a mans head turned sideways was clearly visible on the blind\\n      and that this shadow was certainly not that of peter carey whom\\n      he knew well it was that of a bearded man but the beard was\\n      short and bristled forward in a way very different from that of\\n      the captain so he says but he had been two hours in the\\n      publichouse and it is some distance from the road to the\\n      window besides this refers to the monday and the crime was\\n      done upon the wednesday\\n\\n      on the tuesday peter carey was in one of his blackest moods\\n      flushed with drink and as savage as a dangerous wild beast he\\n      roamed about the house and the women ran for it when they heard\\n      him coming late in the evening he went down to his own hut\\n      about two oclock the following morning his daughter who slept\\n      with her window open heard a most fearful yell from that\\n      direction but it was no unusual thing for him to bawl and shout\\n      when he was in drink so no notice was taken on rising at seven\\n      one of the maids noticed that the door of the hut was open but\\n      so great was the terror which the man caused that it was midday\\n      before anyone would venture down to see what had become of him\\n      peeping into the open door they saw a sight which sent them\\n      flying with white faces into the village within an hour i was\\n      on the spot and had taken over the case\\n\\n      well i have fairly steady nerves as you know mr holmes but\\n      i give you my word that i got a shake when i put my head into\\n      that little house it was droning like a harmonium with the flies\\n      and bluebottles and the floor and walls were like a\\n      slaughterhouse he had called it a cabin and a cabin it was\\n      sure enough for you would have thought that you were in a ship\\n      there was a bunk at one end a seachest maps and charts a\\n      picture of the sea unicorn a line of logbooks on a shelf all\\n      exactly as one would expect to find it in a captains room and\\n      there in the middle of it was the man himselfhis face twisted\\n      like a lost soul in torment and his great brindled beard stuck\\n      upward in his agony right through his broad breast a steel\\n      harpoon had been driven and it had sunk deep into the wood of\\n      the wall behind him he was pinned like a beetle on a card of\\n      course he was quite dead and had been so from the instant that\\n      he had uttered that last yell of agony\\n\\n      i know your methods sir and i applied them before i permitted\\n      anything to be moved i examined most carefully the ground\\n      outside and also the floor of the room there were no\\n      footmarks\\n\\n      meaning that you saw none\\n\\n      i assure you sir that there were none\\n\\n      my good hopkins i have investigated many crimes but i have\\n      never yet seen one which was committed by a flying creature as\\n      long as the criminal remains upon two legs so long must there be\\n      some indentation some abrasion some trifling displacement which\\n      can be detected by the scientific searcher it is incredible that\\n      this bloodbespattered room contained no trace which could have\\n      aided us i understand however from the inquest that there were\\n      some objects which you failed to overlook\\n\\n      the young inspector winced at my companions ironical comments\\n\\n      i was a fool not to call you in at the time mr holmes however\\n      thats past praying for now yes there were several objects in\\n      the room which called for special attention one was the harpoon\\n      with which the deed was committed it had been snatched down from\\n      a rack on the wall two others remained there and there was a\\n      vacant place for the third on the stock was engraved ss sea\\n      unicorn dundee this seemed to establish that the crime had\\n      been done in a moment of fury and that the murderer had seized\\n      the first weapon which came in his way the fact that the crime\\n      was committed at two in the morning and yet peter carey was\\n      fully dressed suggested that he had an appointment with the\\n      murderer which is borne out by the fact that a bottle of rum and\\n      two dirty glasses stood upon the table\\n\\n      yes said holmes i think that both inferences are\\n      permissible was there any other spirit but rum in the room\\n\\n      yes there was a tantalus containing brandy and whisky on the\\n      seachest it is of no importance to us however since the\\n      decanters were full and it had therefore not been used\\n\\n      for all that its presence has some significance said holmes\\n      however let us hear some more about the objects which do seem\\n      to you to bear upon the case\\n\\n      there was this tobaccopouch upon the table\\n\\n      what part of the table\\n\\n      it lay in the middle it was of coarse sealskinthe\\n      straighthaired skin with a leather thong to bind it inside was\\n      pc on the flap there was half an ounce of strong ships\\n      tobacco in it\\n\\n      excellent what more\\n\\n      stanley hopkins drew from his pocket a drabcovered notebook the\\n      outside was rough and worn the leaves discoloured on the first\\n      page were written the initials jhn and the date \\n      holmes laid it on the table and examined it in his minute way\\n      while hopkins and i gazed over each shoulder on the second page\\n      were the printed letters cpr and then came several sheets\\n      of numbers another heading was argentine another costa\\n      rica and another san paulo each with pages of signs and\\n      figures after it\\n\\n      what do you make of these asked holmes\\n\\n      they appear to be lists of stock exchange securities i thought\\n      that jhn were the initials of a broker and that cpr\\n      may have been his client\\n\\n      try canadian pacific railway said holmes\\n\\n      stanley hopkins swore between his teeth and struck his thigh\\n      with his clenched hand\\n\\n      what a fool i have been he cried of course it is as you\\n      say then jhn are the only initials we have to solve i have\\n      already examined the old stock exchange lists and i can find no\\n      one in  either in the house or among the outside brokers\\n      whose initials correspond with these yet i feel that the clue is\\n      the most important one that i hold you will admit mr holmes\\n      that there is a possibility that these initials are those of the\\n      second person who was presentin other words of the murderer i\\n      would also urge that the introduction into the case of a document\\n      relating to large masses of valuable securities gives us for the\\n      first time some indication of a motive for the crime\\n\\n      sherlock holmess face showed that he was thoroughly taken aback\\n      by this new development\\n\\n      i must admit both your points said he i confess that this\\n      notebook which did not appear at the inquest modifies any views\\n      which i may have formed i had come to a theory of the crime in\\n      which i can find no place for this have you endeavoured to trace\\n      any of the securities here mentioned\\n\\n      inquiries are now being made at the offices but i fear that the\\n      complete register of the stockholders of these south american\\n      concerns is in south america and that some weeks must elapse\\n      before we can trace the shares\\n\\n      holmes had been examining the cover of the notebook with his\\n      magnifying lens\\n\\n      surely there is some discolouration here said he\\n\\n      yes sir it is a bloodstain i told you that i picked the book\\n      off the floor\\n\\n      was the bloodstain above or below\\n\\n      on the side next the boards\\n\\n      which proves of course that the book was dropped after the\\n      crime was committed\\n\\n      exactly mr holmes i appreciated that point and i conjectured\\n      that it was dropped by the murderer in his hurried flight it lay\\n      near the door\\n\\n      i suppose that none of these securities have been found among\\n      the property of the dead man\\n\\n      no sir\\n\\n      have you any reason to suspect robbery\\n\\n      no sir nothing seemed to have been touched\\n\\n      dear me it is certainly a very interesting case then there was\\n      a knife was there not\\n\\n      a sheathknife still in its sheath it lay at the feet of the\\n      dead man mrs carey has identified it as being her husbands\\n      property\\n\\n      holmes was lost in thought for some time\\n\\n      well said he at last i suppose i shall have to come out and\\n      have a look at it\\n\\n      stanley hopkins gave a cry of joy\\n\\n      thank you sir that will indeed be a weight off my mind\\n\\n      holmes shook his finger at the inspector\\n\\n      it would have been an easier task a week ago said he but\\n      even now my visit may not be entirely fruitless watson if you\\n      can spare the time i should be very glad of your company if you\\n      will call a fourwheeler hopkins we shall be ready to start for\\n      forest row in a quarter of an hour\\n\\n      alighting at the small wayside station we drove for some miles\\n      through the remains of widespread woods which were once part of\\n      that great forest which for so long held the saxon invaders at\\n      baythe impenetrable weald for sixty years the bulwark of\\n      britain vast sections of it have been cleared for this is the\\n      seat of the first ironworks of the country and the trees have\\n      been felled to smelt the ore now the richer fields of the north\\n      have absorbed the trade and nothing save these ravaged groves\\n      and great scars in the earth show the work of the past here in\\n      a clearing upon the green slope of a hill stood a long low\\n      stone house approached by a curving drive running through the\\n      fields nearer the road and surrounded on three sides by bushes\\n      was a small outhouse one window and the door facing in our\\n      direction it was the scene of the murder\\n\\n      stanley hopkins led us first to the house where he introduced us\\n      to a haggard greyhaired woman the widow of the murdered man\\n      whose gaunt and deeplined face with the furtive look of terror\\n      in the depths of her redrimmed eyes told of the years of\\n      hardship and illusage which she had endured with her was her\\n      daughter a pale fairhaired girl whose eyes blazed defiantly\\n      at us as she told us that she was glad that her father was dead\\n      and that she blessed the hand which had struck him down it was a\\n      terrible household that black peter carey had made for himself\\n      and it was with a sense of relief that we found ourselves in the\\n      sunlight again and making our way along a path which had been\\n      worn across the fields by the feet of the dead man\\n\\n      the outhouse was the simplest of dwellings woodenwalled\\n      shingleroofed one window beside the door and one on the farther\\n      side stanley hopkins drew the key from his pocket and had\\n      stooped to the lock when he paused with a look of attention and\\n      surprise upon his face\\n\\n      someone has been tampering with it he said\\n\\n      there could be no doubt of the fact the woodwork was cut and\\n      the scratches showed white through the paint as if they had been\\n      that instant done holmes had been examining the window\\n\\n      someone has tried to force this also whoever it was has failed\\n      to make his way in he must have been a very poor burglar\\n\\n      this is a most extraordinary thing said the inspector i\\n      could swear that these marks were not here yesterday evening\\n\\n      some curious person from the village perhaps i suggested\\n\\n      very unlikely few of them would dare to set foot in the\\n      grounds far less try to force their way into the cabin what do\\n      you think of it mr holmes\\n\\n      i think that fortune is very kind to us\\n\\n      you mean that the person will come again\\n\\n      it is very probable he came expecting to find the door open he\\n      tried to get in with the blade of a very small penknife he could\\n      not manage it what would he do\\n\\n      come again next night with a more useful tool\\n\\n      so i should say it will be our fault if we are not there to\\n      receive him meanwhile let me see the inside of the cabin\\n\\n      the traces of the tragedy had been removed but the furniture\\n      within the little room still stood as it had been on the night of\\n      the crime for two hours with most intense concentration holmes\\n      examined every object in turn but his face showed that his quest\\n      was not a successful one once only he paused in his patient\\n      investigation\\n\\n      have you taken anything off this shelf hopkins\\n\\n      no i have moved nothing\\n\\n      something has been taken there is less dust in this corner of\\n      the shelf than elsewhere it may have been a book lying on its\\n      side it may have been a box well well i can do nothing more\\n      let us walk in these beautiful woods watson and give a few\\n      hours to the birds and the flowers we shall meet you here later\\n      hopkins and see if we can come to closer quarters with the\\n      gentleman who has paid this visit in the night\\n\\n      it was past eleven oclock when we formed our little ambuscade\\n      hopkins was for leaving the door of the hut open but holmes was\\n      of the opinion that this would rouse the suspicions of the\\n      stranger the lock was a perfectly simple one and only a strong\\n      blade was needed to push it back holmes also suggested that we\\n      should wait not inside the hut but outside it among the bushes\\n      which grew round the farther window in this way we should be\\n      able to watch our man if he struck a light and see what his\\n      object was in this stealthy nocturnal visit\\n\\n      it was a long and melancholy vigil and yet brought with it\\n      something of the thrill which the hunter feels when he lies\\n      beside the waterpool and waits for the coming of the thirsty\\n      beast of prey what savage creature was it which might steal upon\\n      us out of the darkness was it a fierce tiger of crime which\\n      could only be taken fighting hard with flashing fang and claw or\\n      would it prove to be some skulking jackal dangerous only to the\\n      weak and unguarded\\n\\n      in absolute silence we crouched amongst the bushes waiting for\\n      whatever might come at first the steps of a few belated\\n      villagers or the sound of voices from the village lightened our\\n      vigil but one by one these interruptions died away and an\\n      absolute stillness fell upon us save for the chimes of the\\n      distant church which told us of the progress of the night and\\n      for the rustle and whisper of a fine rain falling amid the\\n      foliage which roofed us in\\n\\n      halfpast two had chimed and it was the darkest hour which\\n      precedes the dawn when we all started as a low but sharp click\\n      came from the direction of the gate someone had entered the\\n      drive again there was a long silence and i had begun to fear\\n      that it was a false alarm when a stealthy step was heard upon\\n      the other side of the hut and a moment later a metallic scraping\\n      and clinking the man was trying to force the lock this time his\\n      skill was greater or his tool was better for there was a sudden\\n      snap and the creak of the hinges then a match was struck and\\n      next instant the steady light from a candle filled the interior\\n      of the hut through the gauze curtain our eyes were all riveted\\n      upon the scene within\\n\\n      the nocturnal visitor was a young man frail and thin with a\\n      black moustache which intensified the deadly pallor of his face\\n      he could not have been much above twenty years of age i have\\n      never seen any human being who appeared to be in such a pitiable\\n      fright for his teeth were visibly chattering and he was shaking\\n      in every limb he was dressed like a gentleman in norfolk jacket\\n      and knickerbockers with a cloth cap upon his head we watched\\n      him staring round with frightened eyes then he laid the\\n      candleend upon the table and disappeared from our view into one\\n      of the corners he returned with a large book one of the\\n      logbooks which formed a line upon the shelves leaning on the\\n      table he rapidly turned over the leaves of this volume until he\\n      came to the entry which he sought then with an angry gesture of\\n      his clenched hand he closed the book replaced it in the corner\\n      and put out the light he had hardly turned to leave the hut when\\n      hopkins hand was on the fellows collar and i heard his loud\\n      gasp of terror as he understood that he was taken the candle was\\n      relit and there was our wretched captive shivering and cowering\\n      in the grasp of the detective he sank down upon the seachest\\n      and looked helplessly from one of us to the other\\n\\n      now my fine fellow said stanley hopkins who are you and\\n      what do you want here\\n\\n      the man pulled himself together and faced us with an effort at\\n      selfcomposure\\n\\n      you are detectives i suppose said he you imagine i am\\n      connected with the death of captain peter carey i assure you\\n      that i am innocent\\n\\n      well see about that said hopkins first of all what is your\\n      name\\n\\n      it is john hopley neligan\\n\\n      i saw holmes and hopkins exchange a quick glance\\n\\n      what are you doing here\\n\\n      can i speak confidentially\\n\\n      no certainly not\\n\\n      why should i tell you\\n\\n      if you have no answer it may go badly with you at the trial\\n\\n      the young man winced\\n\\n      well i will tell you he said why should i not and yet i\\n      hate to think of this old scandal gaining a new lease of life\\n      did you ever hear of dawson and neligan\\n\\n      i could see from hopkinss face that he never had but holmes\\n      was keenly interested\\n\\n      you mean the west country bankers said he they failed for a\\n      million ruined half the county families of cornwall and neligan\\n      disappeared\\n\\n      exactly neligan was my father\\n\\n      at last we were getting something positive and yet it seemed a\\n      long gap between an absconding banker and captain peter carey\\n      pinned against the wall with one of his own harpoons we all\\n      listened intently to the young mans words\\n\\n      it was my father who was really concerned dawson had retired i\\n      was only ten years of age at the time but i was old enough to\\n      feel the shame and horror of it all it has always been said that\\n      my father stole all the securities and fled it is not true it\\n      was his belief that if he were given time in which to realize\\n      them all would be well and every creditor paid in full he\\n      started in his little yacht for norway just before the warrant\\n      was issued for his arrest i can remember that last night when he\\n      bade farewell to my mother he left us a list of the securities\\n      he was taking and he swore that he would come back with his\\n      honour cleared and that none who had trusted him would suffer\\n      well no word was ever heard from him again both the yacht and\\n      he vanished utterly we believed my mother and i that he and\\n      it with the securities that he had taken with him were at the\\n      bottom of the sea we had a faithful friend however who is a\\n      business man and it was he who discovered some time ago that\\n      some of the securities which my father had with him had\\n      reappeared on the london market you can imagine our amazement i\\n      spent months in trying to trace them and at last after many\\n      doubtings and difficulties i discovered that the original seller\\n      had been captain peter carey the owner of this hut\\n\\n      naturally i made some inquiries about the man i found that he\\n      had been in command of a whaler which was due to return from the\\n      arctic seas at the very time when my father was crossing to\\n      norway the autumn of that year was a stormy one and there was a\\n      long succession of southerly gales my fathers yacht may well\\n      have been blown to the north and there met by captain peter\\n      careys ship if that were so what had become of my father in\\n      any case if i could prove from peter careys evidence how these\\n      securities came on the market it would be a proof that my father\\n      had not sold them and that he had no view to personal profit\\n      when he took them\\n\\n      i came down to sussex with the intention of seeing the captain\\n      but it was at this moment that his terrible death occurred i\\n      read at the inquest a description of his cabin in which it\\n      stated that the old logbooks of his vessel were preserved in it\\n      it struck me that if i could see what occurred in the month of\\n      august  on board the sea unicorn i might settle the\\n      mystery of my fathers fate i tried last night to get at these\\n      logbooks but was unable to open the door tonight i tried again\\n      and succeeded but i find that the pages which deal with that\\n      month have been torn from the book it was at that moment i found\\n      myself a prisoner in your hands\\n\\n      is that all asked hopkins\\n\\n      yes that is all his eyes shifted as he said it\\n\\n      you have nothing else to tell us\\n\\n      he hesitated\\n\\n      no there is nothing\\n\\n      you have not been here before last night\\n\\n      no\\n\\n      then how do you account for that cried hopkins as he held\\n      up the damning notebook with the initials of our prisoner on the\\n      first leaf and the bloodstain on the cover\\n\\n      the wretched man collapsed he sank his face in his hands and\\n      trembled all over\\n\\n      where did you get it he groaned i did not know i thought i\\n      had lost it at the hotel\\n\\n      that is enough said hopkins sternly whatever else you have\\n      to say you must say in court you will walk down with me now to\\n      the policestation well mr holmes i am very much obliged to\\n      you and to your friend for coming down to help me as it turns\\n      out your presence was unnecessary and i would have brought the\\n      case to this successful issue without you but none the less i\\n      am grateful rooms have been reserved for you at the brambletye\\n      hotel so we can all walk down to the village together\\n\\n      well watson what do you think of it asked holmes as we\\n      travelled back next morning\\n\\n      i can see that you are not satisfied\\n\\n      oh yes my dear watson i am perfectly satisfied at the same\\n      time stanley hopkinss methods do not commend themselves to me\\n      i am disappointed in stanley hopkins i had hoped for better\\n      things from him one should always look for a possible\\n      alternative and provide against it it is the first rule of\\n      criminal investigation\\n\\n      what then is the alternative\\n\\n      the line of investigation which i have myself been pursuing it\\n      may give us nothing i cannot tell but at least i shall follow\\n      it to the end\\n\\n      several letters were waiting for holmes at baker street he\\n      snatched one of them up opened it and burst out into a\\n      triumphant chuckle of laughter\\n\\n      excellent watson the alternative develops have you telegraph\\n      forms just write a couple of messages for me sumner shipping\\n      agent ratcliff highway send three men on to arrive ten\\n      tomorrow morningbasil thats my name in those parts the\\n      other is inspector stanley hopkins  lord street brixton\\n      come breakfast tomorrow at ninethirty important wire if\\n      unable to comesherlock holmes there watson this infernal\\n      case has haunted me for ten days i hereby banish it completely\\n      from my presence tomorrow i trust that we shall hear the last\\n      of it forever\\n\\n      sharp at the hour named inspector stanley hopkins appeared and\\n      we sat down together to the excellent breakfast which mrs hudson\\n      had prepared the young detective was in high spirits at his\\n      success\\n\\n      you really think that your solution must be correct asked\\n      holmes\\n\\n      i could not imagine a more complete case\\n\\n      it did not seem to me conclusive\\n\\n      you astonish me mr holmes what more could one ask for\\n\\n      does your explanation cover every point\\n\\n      undoubtedly i find that young neligan arrived at the brambletye\\n      hotel on the very day of the crime he came on the pretence of\\n      playing golf his room was on the groundfloor and he could get\\n      out when he liked that very night he went down to woodmans lee\\n      saw peter carey at the hut quarrelled with him and killed him\\n      with the harpoon then horrified by what he had done he fled\\n      out of the hut dropping the notebook which he had brought with\\n      him in order to question peter carey about these different\\n      securities you may have observed that some of them were marked\\n      with ticks and the othersthe great majoritywere not those\\n      which are ticked have been traced on the london market but the\\n      others presumably were still in the possession of carey and\\n      young neligan according to his own account was anxious to\\n      recover them in order to do the right thing by his fathers\\n      creditors after his flight he did not dare to approach the hut\\n      again for some time but at last he forced himself to do so in\\n      order to obtain the information which he needed surely that is\\n      all simple and obvious\\n\\n      holmes smiled and shook his head\\n\\n      it seems to me to have only one drawback hopkins and that is\\n      that it is intrinsically impossible have you tried to drive a\\n      harpoon through a body no tut tut my dear sir you must really\\n      pay attention to these details my friend watson could tell you\\n      that i spent a whole morning in that exercise it is no easy\\n      matter and requires a strong and practised arm but this blow\\n      was delivered with such violence that the head of the weapon sank\\n      deep into the wall do you imagine that this anmic youth was\\n      capable of so frightful an assault is he the man who hobnobbed\\n      in rum and water with black peter in the dead of the night was\\n      it his profile that was seen on the blind two nights before no\\n      no hopkins it is another and more formidable person for whom we\\n      must seek\\n\\n      the detectives face had grown longer and longer during holmess\\n      speech his hopes and his ambitions were all crumbling about him\\n      but he would not abandon his position without a struggle\\n\\n      you cant deny that neligan was present that night mr holmes\\n      the book will prove that i fancy that i have evidence enough to\\n      satisfy a jury even if you are able to pick a hole in it\\n      besides mr holmes i have laid my hand upon my man as to\\n      this terrible person of yours where is he\\n\\n      i rather fancy that he is on the stair said holmes serenely\\n      i think watson that you would do well to put that revolver\\n      where you can reach it he rose and laid a written paper upon a\\n      sidetable now we are ready said he\\n\\n      there had been some talking in gruff voices outside and now mrs\\n      hudson opened the door to say that there were three men inquiring\\n      for captain basil\\n\\n      show them in one by one said holmes\\n\\n      the first who entered was a little ribston pippin of a man with\\n      ruddy cheeks and fluffy white sidewhiskers holmes had drawn a\\n      letter from his pocket\\n\\n      what name he asked\\n\\n      james lancaster\\n\\n      i am sorry lancaster but the berth is full here is half a\\n      sovereign for your trouble just step into this room and wait\\n      there for a few minutes\\n\\n      the second man was a long driedup creature with lank hair and\\n      sallow cheeks his name was hugh pattins he also received his\\n      dismissal his halfsovereign and the order to wait\\n\\n      the third applicant was a man of remarkable appearance a fierce\\n      bulldog face was framed in a tangle of hair and beard and two\\n      bold dark eyes gleamed behind the cover of thick tufted\\n      overhung eyebrows he saluted and stood sailorfashion turning\\n      his cap round in his hands\\n\\n      your name asked holmes\\n\\n      patrick cairns\\n\\n      harpooner\\n\\n      yes sir twentysix voyages\\n\\n      dundee i suppose\\n\\n      yes sir\\n\\n      and ready to start with an exploring ship\\n\\n      yes sir\\n\\n      what wages\\n\\n      eight pounds a month\\n\\n      could you start at once\\n\\n      as soon as i get my kit\\n\\n      have you your papers\\n\\n      yes sir he took a sheaf of worn and greasy forms from his\\n      pocket holmes glanced over them and returned them\\n\\n      you are just the man i want said he heres the agreement on\\n      the sidetable if you sign it the whole matter will be settled\\n\\n      the seaman lurched across the room and took up the pen\\n\\n      shall i sign here he asked stooping over the table\\n\\n      holmes leaned over his shoulder and passed both hands over his\\n      neck\\n\\n      this will do said he\\n\\n      i heard a click of steel and a bellow like an enraged bull the\\n      next instant holmes and the seaman were rolling on the ground\\n      together he was a man of such gigantic strength that even with\\n      the handcuffs which holmes had so deftly fastened upon his\\n      wrists he would have very quickly overpowered my friend had\\n      hopkins and i not rushed to his rescue only when i pressed the\\n      cold muzzle of the revolver to his temple did he at last\\n      understand that resistance was vain we lashed his ankles with\\n      cord and rose breathless from the struggle\\n\\n      i must really apologize hopkins said sherlock holmes i fear\\n      that the scrambled eggs are cold however you will enjoy the\\n      rest of your breakfast all the better will you not for the\\n      thought that you have brought your case to a triumphant\\n      conclusion\\n\\n      stanley hopkins was speechless with amazement\\n\\n      i dont know what to say mr holmes he blurted out at last\\n      with a very red face it seems to me that i have been making a\\n      fool of myself from the beginning i understand now what i\\n      should never have forgotten that i am the pupil and you are the\\n      master even now i see what you have done but i dont know how\\n      you did it or what it signifies\\n\\n      well well said holmes goodhumouredly we all learn by\\n      experience and your lesson this time is that you should never\\n      lose sight of the alternative you were so absorbed in young\\n      neligan that you could not spare a thought to patrick cairns the\\n      true murderer of peter carey\\n\\n      the hoarse voice of the seaman broke in on our conversation\\n\\n      see here mister said he i make no complaint of being\\n      manhandled in this fashion but i would have you call things by\\n      their right names you say i murdered peter carey i say i\\n      killed peter carey and theres all the difference maybe you\\n      dont believe what i say maybe you think i am just slinging you\\n      a yarn\\n\\n      not at all said holmes let us hear what you have to say\\n\\n      its soon told and by the lord every word of it is truth i\\n      knew black peter and when he pulled out his knife i whipped a\\n      harpoon through him sharp for i knew that it was him or me\\n      thats how he died you can call it murder anyhow id as soon\\n      die with a rope round my neck as with black peters knife in my\\n      heart\\n\\n      how came you there asked holmes\\n\\n      ill tell it you from the beginning just sit me up a little so\\n      as i can speak easy it was in  that it happenedaugust of\\n      that year peter carey was master of the sea unicorn and i was\\n      spare harpooner we were coming out of the icepack on our way\\n      home with head winds and a weeks southerly gale when we picked\\n      up a little craft that had been blown north there was one man on\\n      hera landsman the crew had thought she would founder and had\\n      made for the norwegian coast in the dinghy i guess they were all\\n      drowned well we took him on board this man and he and the\\n      skipper had some long talks in the cabin all the baggage we took\\n      off with him was one tin box so far as i know the mans name\\n      was never mentioned and on the second night he disappeared as if\\n      he had never been it was given out that he had either thrown\\n      himself overboard or fallen overboard in the heavy weather that\\n      we were having only one man knew what had happened to him and\\n      that was me for with my own eyes i saw the skipper tip up his\\n      heels and put him over the rail in the middle watch of a dark\\n      night two days before we sighted the shetland lights well i\\n      kept my knowledge to myself and waited to see what would come of\\n      it when we got back to scotland it was easily hushed up and\\n      nobody asked any questions a stranger died by accident and it\\n      was nobodys business to inquire shortly after peter carey gave\\n      up the sea and it was long years before i could find where he\\n      was i guessed that he had done the deed for the sake of what was\\n      in that tin box and that he could afford now to pay me well for\\n      keeping my mouth shut i found out where he was through a sailor\\n      man that had met him in london and down i went to squeeze him\\n      the first night he was reasonable enough and was ready to give\\n      me what would make me free of the sea for life we were to fix it\\n      all two nights later when i came i found him three parts drunk\\n      and in a vile temper we sat down and we drank and we yarned\\n      about old times but the more he drank the less i liked the look\\n      on his face i spotted that harpoon upon the wall and i thought\\n      i might need it before i was through then at last he broke out\\n      at me spitting and cursing with murder in his eyes and a great\\n      claspknife in his hand he had not time to get it from the\\n      sheath before i had the harpoon through him heavens what a yell\\n      he gave and his face gets between me and my sleep i stood\\n      there with his blood splashing round me and i waited for a bit\\n      but all was quiet so i took heart once more i looked round and\\n      there was the tin box on the shelf i had as much right to it as\\n      peter carey anyhow so i took it with me and left the hut like\\n      a fool i left my baccypouch upon the table\\n\\n      now ill tell you the queerest part of the whole story i had\\n      hardly got outside the hut when i heard someone coming and i hid\\n      among the bushes a man came slinking along went into the hut\\n      gave a cry as if he had seen a ghost and legged it as hard as he\\n      could run until he was out of sight who he was or what he wanted\\n      is more than i can tell for my part i walked ten miles got a\\n      train at tunbridge wells and so reached london and no one the\\n      wiser\\n\\n      well when i came to examine the box i found there was no money\\n      in it and nothing but papers that i would not dare to sell i\\n      had lost my hold on black peter and was stranded in london\\n      without a shilling there was only my trade left i saw these\\n      advertisements about harpooners and high wages so i went to the\\n      shipping agents and they sent me here thats all i know and i\\n      say again that if i killed black peter the law should give me\\n      thanks for i saved them the price of a hempen rope\\n\\n      a very clear statement said holmes rising and lighting his\\n      pipe i think hopkins that you should lose no time in\\n      conveying your prisoner to a place of safety this room is not\\n      well adapted for a cell and mr patrick cairns occupies too\\n      large a proportion of our carpet\\n\\n      mr holmes said hopkins i do not know how to express my\\n      gratitude even now i do not understand how you attained this\\n      result\\n\\n      simply by having the good fortune to get the right clue from the\\n      beginning it is very possible if i had known about this notebook\\n      it might have led away my thoughts as it did yours but all i\\n      heard pointed in the one direction the amazing strength the\\n      skill in the use of the harpoon the rum and water the sealskin\\n      tobaccopouch with the coarse tobaccoall these pointed to a\\n      seaman and one who had been a whaler i was convinced that the\\n      initials pc upon the pouch were a coincidence and not those\\n      of peter carey since he seldom smoked and no pipe was found in\\n      his cabin you remember that i asked whether whisky and brandy\\n      were in the cabin you said they were how many landsmen are\\n      there who would drink rum when they could get these other\\n      spirits yes i was certain it was a seaman\\n\\n      and how did you find him\\n\\n      my dear sir the problem had become a very simple one if it\\n      were a seaman it could only be a seaman who had been with him on\\n      the sea unicorn so far as i could learn he had sailed in no\\n      other ship i spent three days in wiring to dundee and at the\\n      end of that time i had ascertained the names of the crew of the\\n      sea unicorn in  when i found patrick cairns among the\\n      harpooners my research was nearing its end i argued that the\\n      man was probably in london and that he would desire to leave the\\n      country for a time i therefore spent some days in the east end\\n      devised an arctic expedition put forth tempting terms for\\n      harpooners who would serve under captain basiland behold the\\n      result\\n\\n      wonderful cried hopkins wonderful\\n\\n      you must obtain the release of young neligan as soon as\\n      possible said holmes i confess that i think you owe him some\\n      apology the tin box must be returned to him but of course the\\n      securities which peter carey has sold are lost forever theres\\n      the cab hopkins and you can remove your man if you want me for\\n      the trial my address and that of watson will be somewhere in\\n      norwayill send particulars later\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe adventure of charles augustus milverton\\n\\n\\n      it is years since the incidents of which i speak took place and\\n      yet it is with diffidence that i allude to them for a long time\\n      even with the utmost discretion and reticence it would have been\\n      impossible to make the facts public but now the principal person\\n      concerned is beyond the reach of human law and with due\\n      suppression the story may be told in such fashion as to injure no\\n      one it records an absolutely unique experience in the career\\n      both of mr sherlock holmes and of myself the reader will excuse\\n      me if i conceal the date or any other fact by which he might\\n      trace the actual occurrence\\n\\n      we had been out for one of our evening rambles holmes and i and\\n      had returned about six oclock on a cold frosty winters\\n      evening as holmes turned up the lamp the light fell upon a card\\n      on the table he glanced at it and then with an ejaculation of\\n      disgust threw it on the floor i picked it up and read\\n\\n      charles augustus milverton\\n      appledore towers\\n      hampstead\\n      agent\\n\\n      who is he i asked\\n\\n      the worst man in london holmes answered as he sat down and\\n      stretched his legs before the fire is anything on the back of\\n      the card\\n\\n      i turned it over\\n\\n      will call at cam i read\\n\\n      hum hes about due do you feel a creeping shrinking\\n      sensation watson when you stand before the serpents in the zoo\\n      and see the slithery gliding venomous creatures with their\\n      deadly eyes and wicked flattened faces well thats how\\n      milverton impresses me ive had to do with fifty murderers in my\\n      career but the worst of them never gave me the repulsion which i\\n      have for this fellow and yet i cant get out of doing business\\n      with himindeed he is here at my invitation\\n\\n      but who is he\\n\\n      ill tell you watson he is the king of all the blackmailers\\n      heaven help the man and still more the woman whose secret and\\n      reputation come into the power of milverton with a smiling face\\n      and a heart of marble he will squeeze and squeeze until he has\\n      drained them dry the fellow is a genius in his way and would\\n      have made his mark in some more savoury trade his method is as\\n      follows he allows it to be known that he is prepared to pay very\\n      high sums for letters which compromise people of wealth and\\n      position he receives these wares not only from treacherous\\n      valets or maids but frequently from genteel ruffians who have\\n      gained the confidence and affection of trusting women he deals\\n      with no niggard hand i happen to know that he paid seven hundred\\n      pounds to a footman for a note two lines in length and that the\\n      ruin of a noble family was the result everything which is in the\\n      market goes to milverton and there are hundreds in this great\\n      city who turn white at his name no one knows where his grip may\\n      fall for he is far too rich and far too cunning to work from\\n      hand to mouth he will hold a card back for years in order to\\n      play it at the moment when the stake is best worth winning i\\n      have said that he is the worst man in london and i would ask you\\n      how could one compare the ruffian who in hot blood bludgeons his\\n      mate with this man who methodically and at his leisure tortures\\n      the soul and wrings the nerves in order to add to his already\\n      swollen moneybags\\n\\n      i had seldom heard my friend speak with such intensity of\\n      feeling\\n\\n      but surely said i the fellow must be within the grasp of the\\n      law\\n\\n      technically no doubt but practically not what would it profit\\n      a woman for example to get him a few months imprisonment if\\n      her own ruin must immediately follow his victims dare not hit\\n      back if ever he blackmailed an innocent person then indeed we\\n      should have him but he is as cunning as the evil one no no we\\n      must find other ways to fight him\\n\\n      and why is he here\\n\\n      because an illustrious client has placed her piteous case in my\\n      hands it is the lady eva blackwell the most beautiful\\n      dbutante of last season she is to be married in a fortnight\\n      to the earl of dovercourt this fiend has several imprudent\\n      lettersimprudent watson nothing worsewhich were written to an\\n      impecunious young squire in the country they would suffice to\\n      break off the match milverton will send the letters to the earl\\n      unless a large sum of money is paid him i have been commissioned\\n      to meet him andto make the best terms i can\\n\\n      at that instant there was a clatter and a rattle in the street\\n      below looking down i saw a stately carriage and pair the\\n      brilliant lamps gleaming on the glossy haunches of the noble\\n      chestnuts a footman opened the door and a small stout man in a\\n      shaggy astrakhan overcoat descended a minute later he was in the\\n      room\\n\\n      charles augustus milverton was a man of fifty with a large\\n      intellectual head a round plump hairless face a perpetual\\n      frozen smile and two keen grey eyes which gleamed brightly from\\n      behind broad goldrimmed glasses there was something of mr\\n      pickwicks benevolence in his appearance marred only by the\\n      insincerity of the fixed smile and by the hard glitter of those\\n      restless and penetrating eyes his voice was as smooth and suave\\n      as his countenance as he advanced with a plump little hand\\n      extended murmuring his regret for having missed us at his first\\n      visit holmes disregarded the outstretched hand and looked at him\\n      with a face of granite milvertons smile broadened he shrugged\\n      his shoulders removed his overcoat folded it with great\\n      deliberation over the back of a chair and then took a seat\\n\\n      this gentleman said he with a wave in my direction is it\\n      discreet is it right\\n\\n      dr watson is my friend and partner\\n\\n      very good mr holmes it is only in your clients interests\\n      that i protested the matter is so very delicate\\n\\n      dr watson has already heard of it\\n\\n      then we can proceed to business you say that you are acting for\\n      lady eva has she empowered you to accept my terms\\n\\n      what are your terms\\n\\n      seven thousand pounds\\n\\n      and the alternative\\n\\n      my dear sir it is painful for me to discuss it but if the\\n      money is not paid on the th there certainly will be no\\n      marriage on the th his insufferable smile was more complacent\\n      than ever\\n\\n      holmes thought for a little\\n\\n      you appear to me he said at last to be taking matters too\\n      much for granted i am of course familiar with the contents of\\n      these letters my client will certainly do what i may advise i\\n      shall counsel her to tell her future husband the whole story and\\n      to trust to his generosity\\n\\n      milverton chuckled\\n\\n      you evidently do not know the earl said he\\n\\n      from the baffled look upon holmess face i could see clearly\\n      that he did\\n\\n      what harm is there in the letters he asked\\n\\n      they are sprightlyvery sprightly milverton answered the\\n      lady was a charming correspondent but i can assure you that the\\n      earl of dovercourt would fail to appreciate them however since\\n      you think otherwise we will let it rest at that it is purely a\\n      matter of business if you think that it is in the best interests\\n      of your client that these letters should be placed in the hands\\n      of the earl then you would indeed be foolish to pay so large a\\n      sum of money to regain them he rose and seized his astrakhan\\n      coat\\n\\n      holmes was grey with anger and mortification\\n\\n      wait a little he said you go too fast we should certainly\\n      make every effort to avoid scandal in so delicate a matter\\n\\n      milverton relapsed into his chair\\n\\n      i was sure that you would see it in that light he purred\\n\\n      at the same time holmes continued lady eva is not a wealthy\\n      woman i assure you that two thousand pounds would be a drain\\n      upon her resources and that the sum you name is utterly beyond\\n      her power i beg therefore that you will moderate your demands\\n      and that you will return the letters at the price i indicate\\n      which is i assure you the highest that you can get\\n\\n      milvertons smile broadened and his eyes twinkled humorously\\n\\n      i am aware that what you say is true about the ladys\\n      resources said he at the same time you must admit that the\\n      occasion of a ladys marriage is a very suitable time for her\\n      friends and relatives to make some little effort upon her behalf\\n      they may hesitate as to an acceptable wedding present let me\\n      assure them that this little bundle of letters would give more\\n      joy than all the candelabra and butterdishes in london\\n\\n      it is impossible said holmes\\n\\n      dear me dear me how unfortunate cried milverton taking out\\n      a bulky pocketbook i cannot help thinking that ladies are\\n      illadvised in not making an effort look at this he held up a\\n      little note with a coatofarms upon the envelope that belongs\\n      towell perhaps it is hardly fair to tell the name until\\n      tomorrow morning but at that time it will be in the hands of\\n      the ladys husband and all because she will not find a beggarly\\n      sum which she could get by turning her diamonds into paste it\\n      is such a pity now you remember the sudden end of the\\n      engagement between the honourable miss miles and colonel dorking\\n      only two days before the wedding there was a paragraph in the\\n      morning post to say that it was all off and why it is almost\\n      incredible but the absurd sum of twelve hundred pounds would\\n      have settled the whole question is it not pitiful and here i\\n      find you a man of sense boggling about terms when your\\n      clients future and honour are at stake you surprise me mr\\n      holmes\\n\\n      what i say is true holmes answered the money cannot be\\n      found surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum\\n      which i offer than to ruin this womans career which can profit\\n      you in no way\\n\\n      there you make a mistake mr holmes an exposure would profit\\n      me indirectly to a considerable extent i have eight or ten\\n      similar cases maturing if it was circulated among them that i\\n      had made a severe example of the lady eva i should find all of\\n      them much more open to reason you see my point\\n\\n      holmes sprang from his chair\\n\\n      get behind him watson dont let him out now sir let us see\\n      the contents of that notebook\\n\\n      milverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room\\n      and stood with his back against the wall\\n\\n      mr holmes mr holmes he said turning the front of his coat\\n      and exhibiting the butt of a large revolver which projected from\\n      the inside pocket i have been expecting you to do something\\n      original this has been done so often and what good has ever\\n      come from it i assure you that i am armed to the teeth and i am\\n      perfectly prepared to use my weapons knowing that the law will\\n      support me besides your supposition that i would bring the\\n      letters here in a notebook is entirely mistaken i would do\\n      nothing so foolish and now gentlemen i have one or two little\\n      interviews this evening and it is a long drive to hampstead he\\n      stepped forward took up his coat laid his hand on his revolver\\n      and turned to the door i picked up a chair but holmes shook his\\n      head and i laid it down again with bow a smile and a twinkle\\n      milverton was out of the room and a few moments after we heard\\n      the slam of the carriage door and the rattle of the wheels as he\\n      drove away\\n\\n      holmes sat motionless by the fire his hands buried deep in his\\n      trouser pockets his chin sunk upon his breast his eyes fixed\\n      upon the glowing embers for half an hour he was silent and\\n      still then with the gesture of a man who has taken his\\n      decision he sprang to his feet and passed into his bedroom a\\n      little later a rakish young workman with a goatee beard and a\\n      swagger lit his clay pipe at the lamp before descending into the\\n      street ill be back some time watson said he and vanished\\n      into the night i understood that he had opened his campaign\\n      against charles augustus milverton but i little dreamed the\\n      strange shape which that campaign was destined to take\\n\\n      for some days holmes came and went at all hours in this attire\\n      but beyond a remark that his time was spent at hampstead and\\n      that it was not wasted i knew nothing of what he was doing at\\n      last however on a wild tempestuous evening when the wind\\n      screamed and rattled against the windows he returned from his\\n      last expedition and having removed his disguise he sat before\\n      the fire and laughed heartily in his silent inward fashion\\n\\n      you would not call me a marrying man watson\\n\\n      no indeed\\n\\n      youll be interested to hear that im engaged\\n\\n      my dear fellow i congrat\\n\\n      to milvertons housemaid\\n\\n      good heavens holmes\\n\\n      i wanted information watson\\n\\n      surely you have gone too far\\n\\n      it was a most necessary step i am a plumber with a rising\\n      business escott by name i have walked out with her each\\n      evening and i have talked with her good heavens those talks\\n      however i have got all i wanted i know milvertons house as i\\n      know the palm of my hand\\n\\n      but the girl holmes\\n\\n      he shrugged his shoulders\\n\\n      you cant help it my dear watson you must play your cards as\\n      best you can when such a stake is on the table however i\\n      rejoice to say that i have a hated rival who will certainly cut\\n      me out the instant that my back is turned what a splendid night\\n      it is\\n\\n      you like this weather\\n\\n      it suits my purpose watson i mean to burgle milvertons house\\n      tonight\\n\\n      i had a catching of the breath and my skin went cold at the\\n      words which were slowly uttered in a tone of concentrated\\n      resolution as a flash of lightning in the night shows up in an\\n      instant every detail of a wild landscape so at one glance i\\n      seemed to see every possible result of such an actionthe\\n      detection the capture the honoured career ending in irreparable\\n      failure and disgrace my friend himself lying at the mercy of the\\n      odious milverton\\n\\n      for heavens sake holmes think what you are doing i cried\\n\\n      my dear fellow i have given it every consideration i am never\\n      precipitate in my actions nor would i adopt so energetic and\\n      indeed so dangerous a course if any other were possible let us\\n      look at the matter clearly and fairly i suppose that you will\\n      admit that the action is morally justifiable though technically\\n      criminal to burgle his house is no more than to forcibly take\\n      his pocketbookan action in which you were prepared to aid me\\n\\n      i turned it over in my mind\\n\\n      yes i said it is morally justifiable so long as our object\\n      is to take no articles save those which are used for an illegal\\n      purpose\\n\\n      exactly since it is morally justifiable i have only to\\n      consider the question of personal risk surely a gentleman should\\n      not lay much stress upon this when a lady is in most desperate\\n      need of his help\\n\\n      you will be in such a false position\\n\\n      well that is part of the risk there is no other possible way\\n      of regaining these letters the unfortunate lady has not the\\n      money and there are none of her people in whom she could\\n      confide tomorrow is the last day of grace and unless we can\\n      get the letters tonight this villain will be as good as his\\n      word and will bring about her ruin i must therefore abandon my\\n      client to her fate or i must play this last card between\\n      ourselves watson its a sporting duel between this fellow\\n      milverton and me he had as you saw the best of the first\\n      exchanges but my selfrespect and my reputation are concerned to\\n      fight it to a finish\\n\\n      well i dont like it but i suppose it must be said i when\\n      do we start\\n\\n      you are not coming\\n\\n      then you are not going said i i give you my word of\\n      honourand i never broke it in my lifethat i will take a cab\\n      straight to the policestation and give you away unless you let\\n      me share this adventure with you\\n\\n      you cant help me\\n\\n      how do you know that you cant tell what may happen anyway my\\n      resolution is taken other people besides you have selfrespect\\n      and even reputations\\n\\n      holmes had looked annoyed but his brow cleared and he clapped\\n      me on the shoulder\\n\\n      well well my dear fellow be it so we have shared this same\\n      room for some years and it would be amusing if we ended by\\n      sharing the same cell you know watson i dont mind confessing\\n      to you that i have always had an idea that i would have made a\\n      highly efficient criminal this is the chance of my lifetime in\\n      that direction see here he took a neat little leather case out\\n      of a drawer and opening it he exhibited a number of shining\\n      instruments this is a firstclass uptodate burgling kit\\n      with nickelplated jemmy diamondtipped glasscutter adaptable\\n      keys and every modern improvement which the march of\\n      civilization demands here too is my dark lantern everything\\n      is in order have you a pair of silent shoes\\n\\n      i have rubbersoled tennis shoes\\n\\n      excellent and a mask\\n\\n      i can make a couple out of black silk\\n\\n      i can see that you have a strong natural turn for this sort of\\n      thing very good do you make the masks we shall have some cold\\n      supper before we start it is now ninethirty at eleven we shall\\n      drive as far as church row it is a quarter of an hours walk\\n      from there to appledore towers we shall be at work before\\n      midnight milverton is a heavy sleeper and retires punctually at\\n      tenthirty with any luck we should be back here by two with the\\n      lady evas letters in my pocket\\n\\n      holmes and i put on our dressclothes so that we might appear to\\n      be two theatregoers homeward bound in oxford street we picked\\n      up a hansom and drove to an address in hampstead here we paid\\n      off our cab and with our great coats buttoned up for it was\\n      bitterly cold and the wind seemed to blow through us we walked\\n      along the edge of the heath\\n\\n      its a business that needs delicate treatment said holmes\\n      these documents are contained in a safe in the fellows study\\n      and the study is the anteroom of his bedchamber on the other\\n      hand like all these stout little men who do themselves well he\\n      is a plethoric sleeper agathathats my fiancesays it is a\\n      joke in the servants hall that its impossible to wake the\\n      master he has a secretary who is devoted to his interests and\\n      never budges from the study all day thats why we are going at\\n      night then he has a beast of a dog which roams the garden i met\\n      agatha late the last two evenings and she locks the brute up so\\n      as to give me a clear run this is the house this big one in its\\n      own grounds through the gatenow to the right among the laurels\\n      we might put on our masks here i think you see there is not a\\n      glimmer of light in any of the windows and everything is working\\n      splendidly\\n\\n      with our black silk facecoverings which turned us into two of\\n      the most truculent figures in london we stole up to the silent\\n      gloomy house a sort of tiled veranda extended along one side of\\n      it lined by several windows and two doors\\n\\n      thats his bedroom holmes whispered this door opens straight\\n      into the study it would suit us best but it is bolted as well\\n      as locked and we should make too much noise getting in come\\n      round here theres a greenhouse which opens into the\\n      drawingroom\\n\\n      the place was locked but holmes removed a circle of glass and\\n      turned the key from the inside an instant afterwards he had\\n      closed the door behind us and we had become felons in the eyes\\n      of the law the thick warm air of the conservatory and the rich\\n      choking fragrance of exotic plants took us by the throat he\\n      seized my hand in the darkness and led me swiftly past banks of\\n      shrubs which brushed against our faces holmes had remarkable\\n      powers carefully cultivated of seeing in the dark still\\n      holding my hand in one of his he opened a door and i was\\n      vaguely conscious that we had entered a large room in which a\\n      cigar had been smoked not long before he felt his way among the\\n      furniture opened another door and closed it behind us putting\\n      out my hand i felt several coats hanging from the wall and i\\n      understood that i was in a passage we passed along it and holmes\\n      very gently opened a door upon the righthand side something\\n      rushed out at us and my heart sprang into my mouth but i could\\n      have laughed when i realized that it was the cat a fire was\\n      burning in this new room and again the air was heavy with\\n      tobacco smoke holmes entered on tiptoe waited for me to follow\\n      and then very gently closed the door we were in milvertons\\n      study and a portire at the farther side showed the entrance\\n      to his bedroom\\n\\n      it was a good fire and the room was illuminated by it near the\\n      door i saw the gleam of an electric switch but it was\\n      unnecessary even if it had been safe to turn it on at one side\\n      of the fireplace was a heavy curtain which covered the bay window\\n      we had seen from outside on the other side was the door which\\n      communicated with the veranda a desk stood in the centre with a\\n      turningchair of shining red leather opposite was a large\\n      bookcase with a marble bust of athene on the top in the corner\\n      between the bookcase and the wall there stood a tall green\\n      safe the firelight flashing back from the polished brass knobs\\n      upon its face holmes stole across and looked at it then he\\n      crept to the door of the bedroom and stood with slanting head\\n      listening intently no sound came from within meanwhile it had\\n      struck me that it would be wise to secure our retreat through the\\n      outer door so i examined it to my amazement it was neither\\n      locked nor bolted i touched holmes on the arm and he turned his\\n      masked face in that direction i saw him start and he was\\n      evidently as surprised as i\\n\\n      i dont like it he whispered putting his lips to my very ear\\n      i cant quite make it out anyhow we have no time to lose\\n\\n      can i do anything\\n\\n      yes stand by the door if you hear anyone come bolt it on the\\n      inside and we can get away as we came if they come the other\\n      way we can get through the door if our job is done or hide\\n      behind these window curtains if it is not do you understand\\n\\n      i nodded and stood by the door my first feeling of fear had\\n      passed away and i thrilled now with a keener zest than i had\\n      ever enjoyed when we were the defenders of the law instead of its\\n      defiers the high object of our mission the consciousness that\\n      it was unselfish and chivalrous the villainous character of our\\n      opponent all added to the sporting interest of the adventure\\n      far from feeling guilty i rejoiced and exulted in our dangers\\n      with a glow of admiration i watched holmes unrolling his case of\\n      instruments and choosing his tool with the calm scientific\\n      accuracy of a surgeon who performs a delicate operation i knew\\n      that the opening of safes was a particular hobby with him and i\\n      understood the joy which it gave him to be confronted with this\\n      green and gold monster the dragon which held in its maw the\\n      reputations of many fair ladies turning up the cuffs of his\\n      dresscoathe had placed his overcoat on a chairholmes laid out\\n      two drills a jemmy and several skeleton keys i stood at the\\n      centre door with my eyes glancing at each of the others ready\\n      for any emergency though indeed my plans were somewhat vague\\n      as to what i should do if we were interrupted for half an hour\\n      holmes worked with concentrated energy laying down one tool\\n      picking up another handling each with the strength and delicacy\\n      of the trained mechanic finally i heard a click the broad green\\n      door swung open and inside i had a glimpse of a number of paper\\n      packets each tied sealed and inscribed holmes picked one out\\n      but it was as hard to read by the flickering fire and he drew\\n      out his little dark lantern for it was too dangerous with\\n      milverton in the next room to switch on the electric light\\n      suddenly i saw him halt listen intently and then in an instant\\n      he had swung the door of the safe to picked up his coat stuffed\\n      his tools into the pockets and darted behind the window curtain\\n      motioning me to do the same\\n\\n      it was only when i had joined him there that i heard what had\\n      alarmed his quicker senses there was a noise somewhere within\\n      the house a door slammed in the distance then a confused dull\\n      murmur broke itself into the measured thud of heavy footsteps\\n      rapidly approaching they were in the passage outside the room\\n      they paused at the door the door opened there was a sharp snick\\n      as the electric light was turned on the door closed once more\\n      and the pungent reek of a strong cigar was borne to our nostrils\\n      then the footsteps continued backward and forward backward and\\n      forward within a few yards of us finally there was a creak from\\n      a chair and the footsteps ceased then a key clicked in a lock\\n      and i heard the rustle of papers\\n\\n      so far i had not dared to look out but now i gently parted the\\n      division of the curtains in front of me and peeped through from\\n      the pressure of holmess shoulder against mine i knew that he\\n      was sharing my observations right in front of us and almost\\n      within our reach was the broad rounded back of milverton it\\n      was evident that we had entirely miscalculated his movements\\n      that he had never been to his bedroom but that he had been\\n      sitting up in some smoking or billiard room in the farther wing\\n      of the house the windows of which we had not seen his broad\\n      grizzled head with its shining patch of baldness was in the\\n      immediate foreground of our vision he was leaning far back in\\n      the red leather chair his legs outstretched a long black cigar\\n      projecting at an angle from his mouth he wore a semimilitary\\n      smoking jacket claretcoloured with a black velvet collar in\\n      his hand he held a long legal document which he was reading in\\n      an indolent fashion blowing rings of tobacco smoke from his lips\\n      as he did so there was no promise of a speedy departure in his\\n      composed bearing and his comfortable attitude\\n\\n      i felt holmess hand steal into mine and give me a reassuring\\n      shake as if to say that the situation was within his powers and\\n      that he was easy in his mind i was not sure whether he had seen\\n      what was only too obvious from my position that the door of the\\n      safe was imperfectly closed and that milverton might at any\\n      moment observe it in my own mind i had determined that if i were\\n      sure from the rigidity of his gaze that it had caught his eye\\n      i would at once spring out throw my great coat over his head\\n      pinion him and leave the rest to holmes but milverton never\\n      looked up he was languidly interested by the papers in his hand\\n      and page after page was turned as he followed the argument of the\\n      lawyer at least i thought when he has finished the document\\n      and the cigar he will go to his room but before he had reached\\n      the end of either there came a remarkable development which\\n      turned our thoughts into quite another channel\\n\\n      several times i had observed that milverton looked at his watch\\n      and once he had risen and sat down again with a gesture of\\n      impatience the idea however that he might have an appointment\\n      at so strange an hour never occurred to me until a faint sound\\n      reached my ears from the veranda outside milverton dropped his\\n      papers and sat rigid in his chair the sound was repeated and\\n      then there came a gentle tap at the door milverton rose and\\n      opened it\\n\\n      well said he curtly you are nearly half an hour late\\n\\n      so this was the explanation of the unlocked door and of the\\n      nocturnal vigil of milverton there was the gentle rustle of a\\n      womans dress i had closed the slit between the curtains as\\n      milvertons face had turned in our direction but now i ventured\\n      very carefully to open it once more he had resumed his seat the\\n      cigar still projecting at an insolent angle from the corner of\\n      his mouth in front of him in the full glare of the electric\\n      light there stood a tall slim dark woman a veil over her\\n      face a mantle drawn round her chin her breath came quick and\\n      fast and every inch of the lithe figure was quivering with\\n      strong emotion\\n\\n      well said milverton you made me lose a good nights rest my\\n      dear i hope youll prove worth it you couldnt come any other\\n      timeeh\\n\\n      the woman shook her head\\n\\n      well if you couldnt you couldnt if the countess is a hard\\n      mistress you have your chance to get level with her now bless\\n      the girl what are you shivering about thats right pull\\n      yourself together now let us get down to business he took a\\n      notebook from the drawer of his desk you say that you have five\\n      letters which compromise the countess dalbert you want to sell\\n      them i want to buy them so far so good it only remains to fix\\n      a price i should want to inspect the letters of course if they\\n      are really good specimensgreat heavens is it you\\n\\n      the woman without a word had raised her veil and dropped the\\n      mantle from her chin it was a dark handsome clearcut face\\n      which confronted milvertona face with a curved nose strong\\n      dark eyebrows shading hard glittering eyes and a straight\\n      thinlipped mouth set in a dangerous smile\\n\\n      it is i she said the woman whose life you have ruined\\n\\n      milverton laughed but fear vibrated in his voice you were so\\n      very obstinate said he why did you drive me to such\\n      extremities i assure you i wouldnt hurt a fly of my own accord\\n      but every man has his business and what was i to do i put the\\n      price well within your means you would not pay\\n\\n      so you sent the letters to my husband and hethe noblest\\n      gentleman that ever lived a man whose boots i was never worthy\\n      to lacehe broke his gallant heart and died you remember that\\n      last night when i came through that door i begged and prayed\\n      you for mercy and you laughed in my face as you are trying to\\n      laugh now only your coward heart cannot keep your lips from\\n      twitching yes you never thought to see me here again but it\\n      was that night which taught me how i could meet you face to face\\n      and alone well charles milverton what have you to say\\n\\n      dont imagine that you can bully me said he rising to his\\n      feet i have only to raise my voice and i could call my servants\\n      and have you arrested but i will make allowance for your natural\\n      anger leave the room at once as you came and i will say no\\n      more\\n\\n      the woman stood with her hand buried in her bosom and the same\\n      deadly smile on her thin lips\\n\\n      you will ruin no more lives as you have ruined mine you will\\n      wring no more hearts as you wrung mine i will free the world of\\n      a poisonous thing take that you houndand thatand thatand\\n      that\\n\\n      she had drawn a little gleaming revolver and emptied barrel\\n      after barrel into milvertons body the muzzle within two feet of\\n      his shirt front he shrank away and then fell forward upon the\\n      table coughing furiously and clawing among the papers then he\\n      staggered to his feet received another shot and rolled upon the\\n      floor youve done me he cried and lay still the woman\\n      looked at him intently and ground her heel into his upturned\\n      face she looked again but there was no sound or movement i\\n      heard a sharp rustle the night air blew into the heated room\\n      and the avenger was gone\\n\\n      no interference upon our part could have saved the man from his\\n      fate but as the woman poured bullet after bullet into\\n      milvertons shrinking body i was about to spring out when i felt\\n      holmess cold strong grasp upon my wrist i understood the whole\\n      argument of that firm restraining gripthat it was no affair of\\n      ours that justice had overtaken a villain that we had our own\\n      duties and our own objects which were not to be lost sight of\\n      but hardly had the woman rushed from the room when holmes with\\n      swift silent steps was over at the other door he turned the\\n      key in the lock at the same instant we heard voices in the house\\n      and the sound of hurrying feet the revolver shots had roused the\\n      household with perfect coolness holmes slipped across to the\\n      safe filled his two arms with bundles of letters and poured\\n      them all into the fire again and again he did it until the safe\\n      was empty someone turned the handle and beat upon the outside of\\n      the door holmes looked swiftly round the letter which had been\\n      the messenger of death for milverton lay all mottled with his\\n      blood upon the table holmes tossed it in among the blazing\\n      papers then he drew the key from the outer door passed through\\n      after me and locked it on the outside this way watson said\\n      he we can scale the garden wall in this direction\\n\\n      i could not have believed that an alarm could have spread so\\n      swiftly looking back the huge house was one blaze of light the\\n      front door was open and figures were rushing down the drive the\\n      whole garden was alive with people and one fellow raised a\\n      viewhalloa as we emerged from the veranda and followed hard at\\n      our heels holmes seemed to know the grounds perfectly and he\\n      threaded his way swiftly among a plantation of small trees i\\n      close at his heels and our foremost pursuer panting behind us\\n      it was a sixfoot wall which barred our path but he sprang to\\n      the top and over as i did the same i felt the hand of the man\\n      behind me grab at my ankle but i kicked myself free and\\n      scrambled over a grassstrewn coping i fell upon my face among\\n      some bushes but holmes had me on my feet in an instant and\\n      together we dashed away across the huge expanse of hampstead\\n      heath we had run two miles i suppose before holmes at last\\n      halted and listened intently all was absolute silence behind us\\n      we had shaken off our pursuers and were safe\\n\\n      we had breakfasted and were smoking our morning pipe on the day\\n      after the remarkable experience which i have recorded when mr\\n      lestrade of scotland yard very solemn and impressive was\\n      ushered into our modest sittingroom\\n\\n      goodmorning mr holmes said he goodmorning may i ask if\\n      you are very busy just now\\n\\n      not too busy to listen to you\\n\\n      i thought that perhaps if you had nothing particular on hand\\n      you might care to assist us in a most remarkable case which\\n      occurred only last night at hampstead\\n\\n      dear me said holmes what was that\\n\\n      a murdera most dramatic and remarkable murder i know how keen\\n      you are upon these things and i would take it as a great favour\\n      if you would step down to appledore towers and give us the\\n      benefit of your advice it is no ordinary crime we have had our\\n      eyes upon this mr milverton for some time and between\\n      ourselves he was a bit of a villain he is known to have held\\n      papers which he used for blackmailing purposes these papers have\\n      all been burned by the murderers no article of value was taken\\n      as it is probable that the criminals were men of good position\\n      whose sole object was to prevent social exposure\\n\\n      criminals said holmes plural\\n\\n      yes there were two of them they were as nearly as possible\\n      captured redhanded we have their footmarks we have their\\n      description its ten to one that we trace them the first fellow\\n      was a bit too active but the second was caught by the\\n      undergardener and only got away after a struggle he was a\\n      middlesized strongly built mansquare jaw thick neck\\n      moustache a mask over his eyes\\n\\n      thats rather vague said sherlock holmes my it might be a\\n      description of watson\\n\\n      its true said the inspector with amusement it might be a\\n      description of watson\\n\\n      well im afraid i cant help you lestrade said holmes the\\n      fact is that i knew this fellow milverton that i considered him\\n      one of the most dangerous men in london and that i think there\\n      are certain crimes which the law cannot touch and which\\n      therefore to some extent justify private revenge no its no\\n      use arguing i have made up my mind my sympathies are with the\\n      criminals rather than with the victim and i will not handle this\\n      case\\n\\n      holmes had not said one word to me about the tragedy which we had\\n      witnessed but i observed all the morning that he was in his most\\n      thoughtful mood and he gave me the impression from his vacant\\n      eyes and his abstracted manner of a man who is striving to\\n      recall something to his memory we were in the middle of our\\n      lunch when he suddenly sprang to his feet by jove watson\\n      ive got it he cried take your hat come with me he hurried\\n      at his top speed down baker street and along oxford street until\\n      we had almost reached regent circus here on the left hand\\n      there stands a shop window filled with photographs of the\\n      celebrities and beauties of the day holmess eyes fixed\\n      themselves upon one of them and following his gaze i saw the\\n      picture of a regal and stately lady in court dress with a high\\n      diamond tiara upon her noble head i looked at that delicately\\n      curved nose at the marked eyebrows at the straight mouth and\\n      the strong little chin beneath it then i caught my breath as i\\n      read the timehonoured title of the great nobleman and statesman\\n      whose wife she had been my eyes met those of holmes and he put\\n      his finger to his lips as we turned away from the window\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe adventure of the six napoleons\\n\\n\\n      it was no very unusual thing for mr lestrade of scotland yard\\n      to look in upon us of an evening and his visits were welcome to\\n      sherlock holmes for they enabled him to keep in touch with all\\n      that was going on at the police headquarters in return for the\\n      news which lestrade would bring holmes was always ready to\\n      listen with attention to the details of any case upon which the\\n      detective was engaged and was able occasionally without any\\n      active interference to give some hint or suggestion drawn from\\n      his own vast knowledge and experience\\n\\n      on this particular evening lestrade had spoken of the weather\\n      and the newspapers then he had fallen silent puffing\\n      thoughtfully at his cigar holmes looked keenly at him\\n\\n      anything remarkable on hand he asked\\n\\n      oh no mr holmesnothing very particular\\n\\n      then tell me about it\\n\\n      lestrade laughed\\n\\n      well mr holmes there is no use denying that there is\\n      something on my mind and yet it is such an absurd business that\\n      i hesitated to bother you about it on the other hand although\\n      it is trivial it is undoubtedly queer and i know that you have\\n      a taste for all that is out of the common but in my opinion it\\n      comes more in dr watsons line than ours\\n\\n      disease said i\\n\\n      madness anyhow and a queer madness too you wouldnt think\\n      there was anyone living at this time of day who had such a hatred\\n      of napoleon the first that he would break any image of him that\\n      he could see\\n\\n      holmes sank back in his chair\\n\\n      thats no business of mine said he\\n\\n      exactly thats what i said but then when the man commits\\n      burglary in order to break images which are not his own that\\n      brings it away from the doctor and on to the policeman\\n\\n      holmes sat up again\\n\\n      burglary this is more interesting let me hear the details\\n\\n      lestrade took out his official notebook and refreshed his memory\\n      from its pages\\n\\n      the first case reported was four days ago said he it was at\\n      the shop of morse hudson who has a place for the sale of\\n      pictures and statues in the kennington road the assistant had\\n      left the front shop for an instant when he heard a crash and\\n      hurrying in he found a plaster bust of napoleon which stood with\\n      several other works of art upon the counter lying shivered into\\n      fragments he rushed out into the road but although several\\n      passersby declared that they had noticed a man run out of the\\n      shop he could neither see anyone nor could he find any means of\\n      identifying the rascal it seemed to be one of those senseless\\n      acts of hooliganism which occur from time to time and it was\\n      reported to the constable on the beat as such the plaster cast\\n      was not worth more than a few shillings and the whole affair\\n      appeared to be too childish for any particular investigation\\n\\n      the second case however was more serious and also more\\n      singular it occurred only last night\\n\\n      in kennington road and within a few hundred yards of morse\\n      hudsons shop there lives a wellknown medical practitioner\\n      named dr barnicot who has one of the largest practices upon the\\n      south side of the thames his residence and principal\\n      consultingroom is at kennington road but he has a branch\\n      surgery and dispensary at lower brixton road two miles away\\n      this dr barnicot is an enthusiastic admirer of napoleon and his\\n      house is full of books pictures and relics of the french\\n      emperor some little time ago he purchased from morse hudson two\\n      duplicate plaster casts of the famous head of napoleon by the\\n      french sculptor devine one of these he placed in his hall in\\n      the house at kennington road and the other on the mantelpiece of\\n      the surgery at lower brixton well when dr barnicot came down\\n      this morning he was astonished to find that his house had been\\n      burgled during the night but that nothing had been taken save\\n      the plaster head from the hall it had been carried out and had\\n      been dashed savagely against the garden wall under which its\\n      splintered fragments were discovered\\n\\n      holmes rubbed his hands\\n\\n      this is certainly very novel said he\\n\\n      i thought it would please you but i have not got to the end\\n      yet dr barnicot was due at his surgery at twelve oclock and\\n      you can imagine his amazement when on arriving there he found\\n      that the window had been opened in the night and that the broken\\n      pieces of his second bust were strewn all over the room it had\\n      been smashed to atoms where it stood in neither case were there\\n      any signs which could give us a clue as to the criminal or\\n      lunatic who had done the mischief now mr holmes you have got\\n      the facts\\n\\n      they are singular not to say grotesque said holmes may i\\n      ask whether the two busts smashed in dr barnicots rooms were\\n      the exact duplicates of the one which was destroyed in morse\\n      hudsons shop\\n\\n      they were taken from the same mould\\n\\n      such a fact must tell against the theory that the man who breaks\\n      them is influenced by any general hatred of napoleon considering\\n      how many hundreds of statues of the great emperor must exist in\\n      london it is too much to suppose such a coincidence as that a\\n      promiscuous iconoclast should chance to begin upon three\\n      specimens of the same bust\\n\\n      well i thought as you do said lestrade on the other hand\\n      this morse hudson is the purveyor of busts in that part of\\n      london and these three were the only ones which had been in his\\n      shop for years so although as you say there are many hundreds\\n      of statues in london it is very probable that these three were\\n      the only ones in that district therefore a local fanatic would\\n      begin with them what do you think dr watson\\n\\n      there are no limits to the possibilities of monomania i\\n      answered there is the condition which the modern french\\n      psychologists have called the ide fixe which may be trifling\\n      in character and accompanied by complete sanity in every other\\n      way a man who had read deeply about napoleon or who had\\n      possibly received some hereditary family injury through the great\\n      war might conceivably form such an ide fixe and under its\\n      influence be capable of any fantastic outrage\\n\\n      that wont do my dear watson said holmes shaking his head\\n      for no amount of ide fixe would enable your interesting\\n      monomaniac to find out where these busts were situated\\n\\n      well how do you explain it\\n\\n      i dont attempt to do so i would only observe that there is a\\n      certain method in the gentlemans eccentric proceedings for\\n      example in dr barnicots hall where a sound might arouse the\\n      family the bust was taken outside before being broken whereas\\n      in the surgery where there was less danger of an alarm it was\\n      smashed where it stood the affair seems absurdly trifling and\\n      yet i dare call nothing trivial when i reflect that some of my\\n      most classic cases have had the least promising commencement you\\n      will remember watson how the dreadful business of the abernetty\\n      family was first brought to my notice by the depth which the\\n      parsley had sunk into the butter upon a hot day i cant afford\\n      therefore to smile at your three broken busts lestrade and i\\n      shall be very much obliged to you if you will let me hear of any\\n      fresh development of so singular a chain of events\\n\\n      the development for which my friend had asked came in a quicker\\n      and an infinitely more tragic form than he could have imagined i\\n      was still dressing in my bedroom next morning when there was a\\n      tap at the door and holmes entered a telegram in his hand he\\n      read it aloud\\n\\n      come instantly  pitt street kensingtonlestrade\\n\\n      what is it then i asked\\n\\n      dont knowmay be anything but i suspect it is the sequel of\\n      the story of the statues in that case our friend the\\n      imagebreaker has begun operations in another quarter of london\\n      theres coffee on the table watson and i have a cab at the\\n      door\\n\\n      in half an hour we had reached pitt street a quiet little\\n      backwater just beside one of the briskest currents of london\\n      life no  was one of a row all flatchested respectable\\n      and most unromantic dwellings as we drove up we found the\\n      railings in front of the house lined by a curious crowd holmes\\n      whistled\\n\\n      by george its attempted murder at the least nothing less will\\n      hold the london messageboy theres a deed of violence indicated\\n      in that fellows round shoulders and outstretched neck whats\\n      this watson the top steps swilled down and the other ones dry\\n      footsteps enough anyhow well well theres lestrade at the\\n      front window and we shall soon know all about it\\n\\n      the official received us with a very grave face and showed us\\n      into a sittingroom where an exceedingly unkempt and agitated\\n      elderly man clad in a flannel dressinggown was pacing up and\\n      down he was introduced to us as the owner of the housemr\\n      horace harker of the central press syndicate\\n\\n      its the napoleon bust business again said lestrade you\\n      seemed interested last night mr holmes so i thought perhaps\\n      you would be glad to be present now that the affair has taken a\\n      very much graver turn\\n\\n      what has it turned to then\\n\\n      to murder mr harker will you tell these gentlemen exactly\\n      what has occurred\\n\\n      the man in the dressinggown turned upon us with a most\\n      melancholy face\\n\\n      its an extraordinary thing said he that all my life i have\\n      been collecting other peoples news and now that a real piece of\\n      news has come my own way i am so confused and bothered that i\\n      cant put two words together if i had come in here as a\\n      journalist i should have interviewed myself and had two columns\\n      in every evening paper as it is i am giving away valuable copy\\n      by telling my story over and over to a string of different\\n      people and i can make no use of it myself however ive heard\\n      your name mr sherlock holmes and if youll only explain this\\n      queer business i shall be paid for my trouble in telling you the\\n      story\\n\\n      holmes sat down and listened\\n\\n      it all seems to centre round that bust of napoleon which i\\n      bought for this very room about four months ago i picked it up\\n      cheap from harding brothers two doors from the high street\\n      station a great deal of my journalistic work is done at night\\n      and i often write until the early morning so it was today i\\n      was sitting in my den which is at the back of the top of the\\n      house about three oclock when i was convinced that i heard\\n      some sounds downstairs i listened but they were not repeated\\n      and i concluded that they came from outside then suddenly about\\n      five minutes later there came a most horrible yellthe most\\n      dreadful sound mr holmes that ever i heard it will ring in my\\n      ears as long as i live i sat frozen with horror for a minute or\\n      two then i seized the poker and went downstairs when i entered\\n      this room i found the window wide open and i at once observed\\n      that the bust was gone from the mantelpiece why any burglar\\n      should take such a thing passes my understanding for it was only\\n      a plaster cast and of no real value whatever\\n\\n      you can see for yourself that anyone going out through that open\\n      window could reach the front doorstep by taking a long stride\\n      this was clearly what the burglar had done so i went round and\\n      opened the door stepping out into the dark i nearly fell over a\\n      dead man who was lying there i ran back for a light and there\\n      was the poor fellow a great gash in his throat and the whole\\n      place swimming in blood he lay on his back his knees drawn up\\n      and his mouth horribly open i shall see him in my dreams i had\\n      just time to blow on my policewhistle and then i must have\\n      fainted for i knew nothing more until i found the policeman\\n      standing over me in the hall\\n\\n      well who was the murdered man asked holmes\\n\\n      theres nothing to show who he was said lestrade you shall\\n      see the body at the mortuary but we have made nothing of it up\\n      to now he is a tall man sunburned very powerful not more than\\n      thirty he is poorly dressed and yet does not appear to be a\\n      labourer a hornhandled clasp knife was lying in a pool of blood\\n      beside him whether it was the weapon which did the deed or\\n      whether it belonged to the dead man i do not know there was no\\n      name on his clothing and nothing in his pockets save an apple\\n      some string a shilling map of london and a photograph here it\\n      is\\n\\n      it was evidently taken by a snapshot from a small camera it\\n      represented an alert sharpfeatured simian man with thick\\n      eyebrows and a very peculiar projection of the lower part of the\\n      face like the muzzle of a baboon\\n\\n      and what became of the bust asked holmes after a careful\\n      study of this picture\\n\\n      we had news of it just before you came it has been found in the\\n      front garden of an empty house in campden house road it was\\n      broken into fragments i am going round now to see it will you\\n      come\\n\\n      certainly i must just take one look round he examined the\\n      carpet and the window the fellow had either very long legs or\\n      was a most active man said he with an area beneath it was no\\n      mean feat to reach that window ledge and open that window\\n      getting back was comparatively simple are you coming with us to\\n      see the remains of your bust mr harker\\n\\n      the disconsolate journalist had seated himself at a\\n      writingtable\\n\\n      i must try and make something of it said he though i have no\\n      doubt that the first editions of the evening papers are out\\n      already with full details its like my luck you remember when\\n      the stand fell at doncaster well i was the only journalist in\\n      the stand and my journal the only one that had no account of it\\n      for i was too shaken to write it and now ill be too late with a\\n      murder done on my own doorstep\\n\\n      as we left the room we heard his pen travelling shrilly over the\\n      foolscap\\n\\n      the spot where the fragments of the bust had been found was only\\n      a few hundred yards away for the first time our eyes rested upon\\n      this presentment of the great emperor which seemed to raise such\\n      frantic and destructive hatred in the mind of the unknown it lay\\n      scattered in splintered shards upon the grass holmes picked up\\n      several of them and examined them carefully i was convinced\\n      from his intent face and his purposeful manner that at last he\\n      was upon a clue\\n\\n      well asked lestrade\\n\\n      holmes shrugged his shoulders\\n\\n      we have a long way to go yet said he and yetand yetwell\\n      we have some suggestive facts to act upon the possession of this\\n      trifling bust was worth more in the eyes of this strange\\n      criminal than a human life that is one point then there is the\\n      singular fact that he did not break it in the house or\\n      immediately outside the house if to break it was his sole\\n      object\\n\\n      he was rattled and bustled by meeting this other fellow he\\n      hardly knew what he was doing\\n\\n      well thats likely enough but i wish to call your attention\\n      very particularly to the position of this house in the garden of\\n      which the bust was destroyed\\n\\n      lestrade looked about him\\n\\n      it was an empty house and so he knew that he would not be\\n      disturbed in the garden\\n\\n      yes but there is another empty house farther up the street\\n      which he must have passed before he came to this one why did he\\n      not break it there since it is evident that every yard that he\\n      carried it increased the risk of someone meeting him\\n\\n      i give it up said lestrade\\n\\n      holmes pointed to the street lamp above our heads\\n\\n      he could see what he was doing here and he could not there\\n      that was his reason\\n\\n      by jove thats true said the detective now that i come to\\n      think of it dr barnicots bust was broken not far from his red\\n      lamp well mr holmes what are we to do with that fact\\n\\n      to remember itto docket it we may come on something later\\n      which will bear upon it what steps do you propose to take now\\n      lestrade\\n\\n      the most practical way of getting at it in my opinion is to\\n      identify the dead man there should be no difficulty about that\\n      when we have found who he is and who his associates are we\\n      should have a good start in learning what he was doing in pitt\\n      street last night and who it was who met him and killed him on\\n      the doorstep of mr horace harker dont you think so\\n\\n      no doubt and yet it is not quite the way in which i should\\n      approach the case\\n\\n      what would you do then\\n\\n      oh you must not let me influence you in any way i suggest that\\n      you go on your line and i on mine we can compare notes\\n      afterwards and each will supplement the other\\n\\n      very good said lestrade\\n\\n      if you are going back to pitt street you might see mr horace\\n      harker tell him for me that i have quite made up my mind and\\n      that it is certain that a dangerous homicidal lunatic with\\n      napoleonic delusions was in his house last night it will be\\n      useful for his article\\n\\n      lestrade stared\\n\\n      you dont seriously believe that\\n\\n      holmes smiled\\n\\n      dont i well perhaps i dont but i am sure that it will\\n      interest mr horace harker and the subscribers of the central\\n      press syndicate now watson i think that we shall find that we\\n      have a long and rather complex days work before us i should be\\n      glad lestrade if you could make it convenient to meet us at\\n      baker street at six oclock this evening until then i should\\n      like to keep this photograph found in the dead mans pocket it\\n      is possible that i may have to ask your company and assistance\\n      upon a small expedition which will have be undertaken tonight\\n      if my chain of reasoning should prove to be correct until then\\n      goodbye and good luck\\n\\n      sherlock holmes and i walked together to the high street where\\n      we stopped at the shop of harding brothers whence the bust had\\n      been purchased a young assistant informed us that mr harding\\n      would be absent until afternoon and that he was himself a\\n      newcomer who could give us no information holmess face showed\\n      his disappointment and annoyance\\n\\n      well well we cant expect to have it all our own way watson\\n      he said at last we must come back in the afternoon if mr\\n      harding will not be here until then i am as you have no doubt\\n      surmised endeavouring to trace these busts to their source in\\n      order to find if there is not something peculiar which may\\n      account for their remarkable fate let us make for mr morse\\n      hudson of the kennington road and see if he can throw any light\\n      upon the problem\\n\\n      a drive of an hour brought us to the picturedealers\\n      establishment he was a small stout man with a red face and a\\n      peppery manner\\n\\n      yes sir on my very counter sir said he what we pay rates\\n      and taxes for i dont know when any ruffian can come in and\\n      break ones goods yes sir it was i who sold dr barnicot his\\n      two statues disgraceful sir a nihilist plotthats what i make\\n      it no one but an anarchist would go about breaking statues red\\n      republicansthats what i call em who did i get the statues\\n      from i dont see what that has to do with it well if you\\n      really want to know i got them from gelder  co in church\\n      street stepney they are a wellknown house in the trade and\\n      have been this twenty years how many had i threetwo and one\\n      are threetwo of dr barnicots and one smashed in broad\\n      daylight on my own counter do i know that photograph no i\\n      dont yes i do though why its beppo he was a kind of\\n      italian piecework man who made himself useful in the shop he\\n      could carve a bit and gild and frame and do odd jobs the\\n      fellow left me last week and ive heard nothing of him since\\n      no i dont know where he came from nor where he went to i had\\n      nothing against him while he was here he was gone two days\\n      before the bust was smashed\\n\\n      well thats all we could reasonably expect from morse hudson\\n      said holmes as we emerged from the shop we have this beppo as\\n      a common factor both in kennington and in kensington so that is\\n      worth a tenmile drive now watson let us make for gelder \\n      co of stepney the source and origin of the busts i shall be\\n      surprised if we dont get some help down there\\n\\n      in rapid succession we passed through the fringe of fashionable\\n      london hotel london theatrical london literary london\\n      commercial london and finally maritime london till we came to\\n      a riverside city of a hundred thousand souls where the tenement\\n      houses swelter and reek with the outcasts of europe here in a\\n      broad thoroughfare once the abode of wealthy city merchants we\\n      found the sculpture works for which we searched outside was a\\n      considerable yard full of monumental masonry inside was a large\\n      room in which fifty workers were carving or moulding the\\n      manager a big blond german received us civilly and gave a clear\\n      answer to all holmess questions a reference to his books showed\\n      that hundreds of casts had been taken from a marble copy of\\n      devines head of napoleon but that the three which had been sent\\n      to morse hudson a year or so before had been half of a batch of\\n      six the other three being sent to harding brothers of\\n      kensington there was no reason why those six should be different\\n      from any of the other casts he could suggest no possible cause\\n      why anyone should wish to destroy themin fact he laughed at the\\n      idea their wholesale price was six shillings but the retailer\\n      would get twelve or more the cast was taken in two moulds from\\n      each side of the face and then these two profiles of plaster of\\n      paris were joined together to make the complete bust the work\\n      was usually done by italians in the room we were in when\\n      finished the busts were put on a table in the passage to dry\\n      and afterwards stored that was all he could tell us\\n\\n      but the production of the photograph had a remarkable effect upon\\n      the manager his face flushed with anger and his brows knotted\\n      over his blue teutonic eyes\\n\\n      ah the rascal he cried yes indeed i know him very well\\n      this has always been a respectable establishment and the only\\n      time that we have ever had the police in it was over this very\\n      fellow it was more than a year ago now he knifed another\\n      italian in the street and then he came to the works with the\\n      police on his heels and he was taken here beppo was his\\n      namehis second name i never knew serve me right for engaging a\\n      man with such a face but he was a good workmanone of the best\\n\\n      what did he get\\n\\n      the man lived and he got off with a year i have no doubt he is\\n      out now but he has not dared to show his nose here we have a\\n      cousin of his here and i daresay he could tell you where he is\\n\\n      no no cried holmes not a word to the cousinnot a word i\\n      beg of you the matter is very important and the farther i go\\n      with it the more important it seems to grow when you referred\\n      in your ledger to the sale of those casts i observed that the\\n      date was june rd of last year could you give me the date when\\n      beppo was arrested\\n\\n      i could tell you roughly by the paylist the manager answered\\n      yes he continued after some turning over of pages he was\\n      paid last on may th\\n\\n      thank you said holmes i dont think that i need intrude upon\\n      your time and patience any more with a last word of caution\\n      that he should say nothing as to our researches we turned our\\n      faces westward once more\\n\\n      the afternoon was far advanced before we were able to snatch a\\n      hasty luncheon at a restaurant a newsbill at the entrance\\n      announced kensington outrage murder by a madman and the\\n      contents of the paper showed that mr horace harker had got his\\n      account into print after all two columns were occupied with a\\n      highly sensational and flowery rendering of the whole incident\\n      holmes propped it against the cruetstand and read it while he\\n      ate once or twice he chuckled\\n\\n      this is all right watson said he listen to this\\n\\n      it is satisfactory to know that there can be no difference of\\n      opinion upon this case since mr lestrade one of the most\\n      experienced members of the official force and mr sherlock\\n      holmes the wellknown consulting expert have each come to the\\n      conclusion that the grotesque series of incidents which have\\n      ended in so tragic a fashion arise from lunacy rather than from\\n      deliberate crime no explanation save mental aberration can cover\\n      the facts\\n\\n      the press watson is a most valuable institution if you only\\n      know how to use it and now if you have quite finished we will\\n      hark back to kensington and see what the manager of harding\\n      brothers has to say on the matter\\n\\n      the founder of that great emporium proved to be a brisk crisp\\n      little person very dapper and quick with a clear head and a\\n      ready tongue\\n\\n      yes sir i have already read the account in the evening papers\\n      mr horace harker is a customer of ours we supplied him with the\\n      bust some months ago we ordered three busts of that sort from\\n      gelder  co of stepney they are all sold now to whom oh i\\n      daresay by consulting our sales book we could very easily tell\\n      you yes we have the entries here one to mr harker you see\\n      and one to mr josiah brown of laburnum lodge laburnum vale\\n      chiswick and one to mr sandeford of lower grove road reading\\n      no i have never seen this face which you show me in the\\n      photograph you would hardly forget it would you sir for ive\\n      seldom seen an uglier have we any italians on the staff yes\\n      sir we have several among our workpeople and cleaners i daresay\\n      they might get a peep at that sales book if they wanted to there\\n      is no particular reason for keeping a watch upon that book well\\n      well its a very strange business and i hope that you will let\\n      me know if anything comes of your inquiries\\n\\n      holmes had taken several notes during mr hardings evidence and\\n      i could see that he was thoroughly satisfied by the turn which\\n      affairs were taking he made no remark however save that\\n      unless we hurried we should be late for our appointment with\\n      lestrade sure enough when we reached baker street the detective\\n      was already there and we found him pacing up and down in a fever\\n      of impatience his look of importance showed that his days work\\n      had not been in vain\\n\\n      well he asked what luck mr holmes\\n\\n      we have had a very busy day and not entirely a wasted one my\\n      friend explained we have seen both the retailers and also the\\n      wholesale manufacturers i can trace each of the busts now from\\n      the beginning\\n\\n      the busts cried lestrade well well you have your own\\n      methods mr sherlock holmes and it is not for me to say a word\\n      against them but i think i have done a better days work than\\n      you i have identified the dead man\\n\\n      you dont say so\\n\\n      and found a cause for the crime\\n\\n      splendid\\n\\n      we have an inspector who makes a specialty of saffron hill and\\n      the italian quarter well this dead man had some catholic emblem\\n      round his neck and that along with his colour made me think he\\n      was from the south inspector hill knew him the moment he caught\\n      sight of him his name is pietro venucci from naples and he is\\n      one of the greatest cutthroats in london he is connected with\\n      the mafia which as you know is a secret political society\\n      enforcing its decrees by murder now you see how the affair\\n      begins to clear up the other fellow is probably an italian also\\n      and a member of the mafia he has broken the rules in some\\n      fashion pietro is set upon his track probably the photograph we\\n      found in his pocket is the man himself so that he may not knife\\n      the wrong person he dogs the fellow he sees him enter a house\\n      he waits outside for him and in the scuffle he receives his own\\n      deathwound how is that mr sherlock holmes\\n\\n      holmes clapped his hands approvingly\\n\\n      excellent lestrade excellent he cried but i didnt quite\\n      follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts\\n\\n      the busts you never can get those busts out of your head after\\n      all that is nothing petty larceny six months at the most it\\n      is the murder that we are really investigating and i tell you\\n      that i am gathering all the threads into my hands\\n\\n      and the next stage\\n\\n      is a very simple one i shall go down with hill to the italian\\n      quarter find the man whose photograph we have got and arrest\\n      him on the charge of murder will you come with us\\n\\n      i think not i fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way i\\n      cant say for certain because it all dependswell it all\\n      depends upon a factor which is completely outside our control\\n      but i have great hopesin fact the betting is exactly two to\\n      onethat if you will come with us tonight i shall be able to\\n      help you to lay him by the heels\\n\\n      in the italian quarter\\n\\n      no i fancy chiswick is an address which is more likely to find\\n      him if you will come with me to chiswick tonight lestrade\\n      ill promise to go to the italian quarter with you tomorrow and\\n      no harm will be done by the delay and now i think that a few\\n      hours sleep would do us all good for i do not propose to leave\\n      before eleven oclock and it is unlikely that we shall be back\\n      before morning youll dine with us lestrade and then you are\\n      welcome to the sofa until it is time for us to start in the\\n      meantime watson i should be glad if you would ring for an\\n      express messenger for i have a letter to send and it is\\n      important that it should go at once\\n\\n      holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the old\\n      daily papers with which one of our lumberrooms was packed when\\n      at last he descended it was with triumph in his eyes but he\\n      said nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches\\n      for my own part i had followed step by step the methods by which\\n      he had traced the various windings of this complex case and\\n      though i could not yet perceive the goal which we would reach i\\n      understood clearly that holmes expected this grotesque criminal\\n      to make an attempt upon the two remaining busts one of which i\\n      remembered was at chiswick no doubt the object of our journey\\n      was to catch him in the very act and i could not but admire the\\n      cunning with which my friend had inserted a wrong clue in the\\n      evening paper so as to give the fellow the idea that he could\\n      continue his scheme with impunity i was not surprised when\\n      holmes suggested that i should take my revolver with me he had\\n      himself picked up the loaded huntingcrop which was his\\n      favourite weapon\\n\\n      a fourwheeler was at the door at eleven and in it we drove to a\\n      spot at the other side of hammersmith bridge here the cabman was\\n      directed to wait a short walk brought us to a secluded road\\n      fringed with pleasant houses each standing in its own grounds\\n      in the light of a street lamp we read laburnum villa upon the\\n      gatepost of one of them the occupants had evidently retired to\\n      rest for all was dark save for a fanlight over the hall door\\n      which shed a single blurred circle on to the garden path the\\n      wooden fence which separated the grounds from the road threw a\\n      dense black shadow upon the inner side and here it was that we\\n      crouched\\n\\n      i fear that youll have a long wait holmes whispered we may\\n      thank our stars that it is not raining i dont think we can even\\n      venture to smoke to pass the time however its a two to one\\n      chance that we get something to pay us for our trouble\\n\\n      it proved however that our vigil was not to be so long as\\n      holmes had led us to fear and it ended in a very sudden and\\n      singular fashion in an instant without the least sound to warn\\n      us of his coming the garden gate swung open and a lithe dark\\n      figure as swift and active as an ape rushed up the garden path\\n      we saw it whisk past the light thrown from over the door and\\n      disappear against the black shadow of the house there was a long\\n      pause during which we held our breath and then a very gentle\\n      creaking sound came to our ears the window was being opened the\\n      noise ceased and again there was a long silence the fellow was\\n      making his way into the house we saw the sudden flash of a dark\\n      lantern inside the room what he sought was evidently not there\\n      for again we saw the flash through another blind and then\\n      through another\\n\\n      let us get to the open window we will nab him as he climbs\\n      out lestrade whispered\\n\\n      but before we could move the man had emerged again as he came\\n      out into the glimmering patch of light we saw that he carried\\n      something white under his arm he looked stealthily all round\\n      him the silence of the deserted street reassured him turning\\n      his back upon us he laid down his burden and the next instant\\n      there was the sound of a sharp tap followed by a clatter and\\n      rattle the man was so intent upon what he was doing that he\\n      never heard our steps as we stole across the grass plot with the\\n      bound of a tiger holmes was on his back and an instant later\\n      lestrade and i had him by either wrist and the handcuffs had\\n      been fastened as we turned him over i saw a hideous sallow\\n      face with writhing furious features glaring up at us and i\\n      knew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we had\\n      secured\\n\\n      but it was not our prisoner to whom holmes was giving his\\n      attention squatted on the doorstep he was engaged in most\\n      carefully examining that which the man had brought from the\\n      house it was a bust of napoleon like the one which we had seen\\n      that morning and it had been broken into similar fragments\\n      carefully holmes held each separate shard to the light but in no\\n      way did it differ from any other shattered piece of plaster he\\n      had just completed his examination when the hall lights flew up\\n      the door opened and the owner of the house a jovial rotund\\n      figure in shirt and trousers presented himself\\n\\n      mr josiah brown i suppose said holmes\\n\\n      yes sir and you no doubt are mr sherlock holmes i had the\\n      note which you sent by the express messenger and i did exactly\\n      what you told me we locked every door on the inside and awaited\\n      developments well im very glad to see that you have got the\\n      rascal i hope gentlemen that you will come in and have some\\n      refreshment\\n\\n      however lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe quarters\\n      so within a few minutes our cab had been summoned and we were all\\n      four upon our way to london not a word would our captive say\\n      but he glared at us from the shadow of his matted hair and once\\n      when my hand seemed within his reach he snapped at it like a\\n      hungry wolf we stayed long enough at the policestation to learn\\n      that a search of his clothing revealed nothing save a few\\n      shillings and a long sheath knife the handle of which bore\\n      copious traces of recent blood\\n\\n      thats all right said lestrade as we parted hill knows all\\n      these gentry and he will give a name to him youll find that my\\n      theory of the mafia will work out all right but im sure i am\\n      exceedingly obliged to you mr holmes for the workmanlike way\\n      in which you laid hands upon him i dont quite understand it all\\n      yet\\n\\n      i fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations said\\n      holmes besides there are one or two details which are not\\n      finished off and it is one of those cases which are worth\\n      working out to the very end if you will come round once more to\\n      my rooms at six oclock tomorrow i think i shall be able to\\n      show you that even now you have not grasped the entire meaning of\\n      this business which presents some features which make it\\n      absolutely original in the history of crime if ever i permit you\\n      to chronicle any more of my little problems watson i foresee\\n      that you will enliven your pages by an account of the singular\\n      adventure of the napoleonic busts\\n\\n      when we met again next evening lestrade was furnished with much\\n      information concerning our prisoner his name it appeared was\\n      beppo second name unknown he was a wellknown neerdowell\\n      among the italian colony he had once been a skilful sculptor and\\n      had earned an honest living but he had taken to evil courses and\\n      had twice already been in jailonce for a petty theft and once\\n      as we had already heard for stabbing a fellowcountryman he\\n      could talk english perfectly well his reasons for destroying the\\n      busts were still unknown and he refused to answer any questions\\n      upon the subject but the police had discovered that these same\\n      busts might very well have been made by his own hands since he\\n      was engaged in this class of work at the establishment of gelder\\n       co to all this information much of which we already knew\\n      holmes listened with polite attention but i who knew him so\\n      well could clearly see that his thoughts were elsewhere and i\\n      detected a mixture of mingled uneasiness and expectation beneath\\n      that mask which he was wont to assume at last he started in his\\n      chair and his eyes brightened there had been a ring at the\\n      bell a minute later we heard steps upon the stairs and an\\n      elderly redfaced man with grizzled sidewhiskers was ushered in\\n      in his right hand he carried an oldfashioned carpetbag which\\n      he placed upon the table\\n\\n      is mr sherlock holmes here\\n\\n      my friend bowed and smiled mr sandeford of reading i\\n      suppose said he\\n\\n      yes sir i fear that i am a little late but the trains were\\n      awkward you wrote to me about a bust that is in my possession\\n\\n      exactly\\n\\n      i have your letter here you said i desire to possess a copy\\n      of devines napoleon and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for\\n      the one which is in your possession is that right\\n\\n      certainly\\n\\n      i was very much surprised at your letter for i could not\\n      imagine how you knew that i owned such a thing\\n\\n      of course you must have been surprised but the explanation is\\n      very simple mr harding of harding brothers said that they had\\n      sold you their last copy and he gave me your address\\n\\n      oh that was it was it did he tell you what i paid for it\\n\\n      no he did not\\n\\n      well i am an honest man though not a very rich one i only\\n      gave fifteen shillings for the bust and i think you ought to\\n      know that before i take ten pounds from you\\n\\n      i am sure the scruple does you honour mr sandeford but i have\\n      named that price so i intend to stick to it\\n\\n      well it is very handsome of you mr holmes i brought the bust\\n      up with me as you asked me to do here it is he opened his\\n      bag and at last we saw placed upon our table a complete specimen\\n      of that bust which we had already seen more than once in\\n      fragments\\n\\n      holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a tenpound note\\n      upon the table\\n\\n      you will kindly sign that paper mr sandeford in the presence\\n      of these witnesses it is simply to say that you transfer every\\n      possible right that you ever had in the bust to me i am a\\n      methodical man you see and you never know what turn events\\n      might take afterwards thank you mr sandeford here is your\\n      money and i wish you a very good evening\\n\\n      when our visitor had disappeared sherlock holmess movements\\n      were such as to rivet our attention he began by taking a clean\\n      white cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table then he\\n      placed his newly acquired bust in the centre of the cloth\\n      finally he picked up his huntingcrop and struck napoleon a\\n      sharp blow on the top of the head the figure broke into\\n      fragments and holmes bent eagerly over the shattered remains\\n      next instant with a loud shout of triumph he held up one\\n      splinter in which a round dark object was fixed like a plum in\\n      a pudding\\n\\n      gentlemen he cried let me introduce you to the famous black\\n      pearl of the borgias\\n\\n      lestrade and i sat silent for a moment and then with a\\n      spontaneous impulse we both broke at clapping as at the\\n      wellwrought crisis of a play a flush of colour sprang to\\n      holmess pale cheeks and he bowed to us like the master\\n      dramatist who receives the homage of his audience it was at such\\n      moments that for an instant he ceased to be a reasoning machine\\n      and betrayed his human love for admiration and applause the same\\n      singularly proud and reserved nature which turned away with\\n      disdain from popular notoriety was capable of being moved to its\\n      depths by spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend\\n\\n      yes gentlemen said he it is the most famous pearl now\\n      existing in the world and it has been my good fortune by a\\n      connected chain of inductive reasoning to trace it from the\\n      prince of colonnas bedroom at the dacre hotel where it was\\n      lost to the interior of this the last of the six busts of\\n      napoleon which were manufactured by gelder  co of stepney you\\n      will remember lestrade the sensation caused by the\\n      disappearance of this valuable jewel and the vain efforts of the\\n      london police to recover it i was myself consulted upon the\\n      case but i was unable to throw any light upon it suspicion fell\\n      upon the maid of the princess who was an italian and it was\\n      proved that she had a brother in london but we failed to trace\\n      any connection between them the maids name was lucretia\\n      venucci and there is no doubt in my mind that this pietro who\\n      was murdered two nights ago was the brother i have been looking\\n      up the dates in the old files of the paper and i find that the\\n      disappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest\\n      of beppo for some crime of violencean event which took place in\\n      the factory of gelder  co at the very moment when these busts\\n      were being made now you clearly see the sequence of events\\n      though you see them of course in the inverse order to the way\\n      in which they presented themselves to me beppo had the pearl in\\n      his possession he may have stolen it from pietro he may have\\n      been pietros confederate he may have been the gobetween of\\n      pietro and his sister it is of no consequence to us which is the\\n      correct solution\\n\\n      the main fact is that he had the pearl and at that moment\\n      when it was on his person he was pursued by the police he made\\n      for the factory in which he worked and he knew that he had only\\n      a few minutes in which to conceal this enormously valuable prize\\n      which would otherwise be found on him when he was searched six\\n      plaster casts of napoleon were drying in the passage one of them\\n      was still soft in an instant beppo a skilful workman made a\\n      small hole in the wet plaster dropped in the pearl and with a\\n      few touches covered over the aperture once more it was an\\n      admirable hidingplace no one could possibly find it but beppo\\n      was condemned to a years imprisonment and in the meanwhile his\\n      six busts were scattered over london he could not tell which\\n      contained his treasure only by breaking them could he see even\\n      shaking would tell him nothing for as the plaster was wet it was\\n      probable that the pearl would adhere to itas in fact it has\\n      done beppo did not despair and he conducted his search with\\n      considerable ingenuity and perseverance through a cousin who\\n      works with gelder he found out the retail firms who had bought\\n      the busts he managed to find employment with morse hudson and\\n      in that way tracked down three of them the pearl was not there\\n      then with the help of some italian employee he succeeded in\\n      finding out where the other three busts had gone the first was\\n      at harkers there he was dogged by his confederate who held\\n      beppo responsible for the loss of the pearl and he stabbed him\\n      in the scuffle which followed\\n\\n      if he was his confederate why should he carry his photograph\\n      i asked\\n\\n      as a means of tracing him if he wished to inquire about him\\n      from any third person that was the obvious reason well after\\n      the murder i calculated that beppo would probably hurry rather\\n      than delay his movements he would fear that the police would\\n      read his secret and so he hastened on before they should get\\n      ahead of him of course i could not say that he had not found\\n      the pearl in harkers bust i had not even concluded for certain\\n      that it was the pearl but it was evident to me that he was\\n      looking for something since he carried the bust past the other\\n      houses in order to break it in the garden which had a lamp\\n      overlooking it since harkers bust was one in three the chances\\n      were exactly as i told youtwo to one against the pearl being\\n      inside it there remained two busts and it was obvious that he\\n      would go for the london one first i warned the inmates of the\\n      house so as to avoid a second tragedy and we went down with\\n      the happiest results by that time of course i knew for certain\\n      that it was the borgia pearl that we were after the name of the\\n      murdered man linked the one event with the other there only\\n      remained a single bustthe reading oneand the pearl must be\\n      there i bought it in your presence from the ownerand there it\\n      lies\\n\\n      we sat in silence for a moment\\n\\n      well said lestrade ive seen you handle a good many cases\\n      mr holmes but i dont know that i ever knew a more workmanlike\\n      one than that were not jealous of you at scotland yard no\\n      sir we are very proud of you and if you come down tomorrow\\n      theres not a man from the oldest inspector to the youngest\\n      constable who wouldnt be glad to shake you by the hand\\n\\n      thank you said holmes thank you and as he turned away it\\n      seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the softer human\\n      emotions than i had ever seen him a moment later he was the cold\\n      and practical thinker once more put the pearl in the safe\\n      watson said he and get out the papers of the conksingleton\\n      forgery case goodbye lestrade if any little problem comes\\n      your way i shall be happy if i can to give you a hint or two\\n      as to its solution\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe adventure of the three students\\n\\n\\n      it was in the year  that a combination of events into which i\\n      need not enter caused mr sherlock holmes and myself to spend\\n      some weeks in one of our great university towns and it was\\n      during this time that the small but instructive adventure which i\\n      am about to relate befell us it will be obvious that any details\\n      which would help the reader exactly to identify the college or\\n      the criminal would be injudicious and offensive so painful a\\n      scandal may well be allowed to die out with due discretion the\\n      incident itself may however be described since it serves to\\n      illustrate some of those qualities for which my friend was\\n      remarkable i will endeavour in my statement to avoid such\\n      terms as would serve to limit the events to any particular place\\n      or give a clue as to the people concerned\\n\\n      we were residing at the time in furnished lodgings close to a\\n      library where sherlock holmes was pursuing some laborious\\n      researches in early english chartersresearches which led to\\n      results so striking that they may be the subject of one of my\\n      future narratives here it was that one evening we received a\\n      visit from an acquaintance mr hilton soames tutor and lecturer\\n      at the college of st lukes mr soames was a tall spare man\\n      of a nervous and excitable temperament i had always known him to\\n      be restless in his manner but on this particular occasion he was\\n      in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it was clear\\n      something very unusual had occurred\\n\\n      i trust mr holmes that you can spare me a few hours of your\\n      valuable time we have had a very painful incident at st lukes\\n      and really but for the happy chance of your being in town i\\n      should have been at a loss what to do\\n\\n      i am very busy just now and i desire no distractions my\\n      friend answered i should much prefer that you called in the aid\\n      of the police\\n\\n      no no my dear sir such a course is utterly impossible when\\n      once the law is evoked it cannot be stayed again and this is\\n      just one of those cases where for the credit of the college it\\n      is most essential to avoid scandal your discretion is as\\n      wellknown as your powers and you are the one man in the world\\n      who can help me i beg you mr holmes to do what you can\\n\\n      my friends temper had not improved since he had been deprived of\\n      the congenial surroundings of baker street without his\\n      scrapbooks his chemicals and his homely untidiness he was an\\n      uncomfortable man he shrugged his shoulders in ungracious\\n      acquiescence while our visitor in hurried words and with much\\n      excitable gesticulation poured forth his story\\n\\n      i must explain to you mr holmes that tomorrow is the first\\n      day of the examination for the fortescue scholarship i am one of\\n      the examiners my subject is greek and the first of the papers\\n      consists of a large passage of greek translation which the\\n      candidate has not seen this passage is printed on the\\n      examination paper and it would naturally be an immense advantage\\n      if the candidate could prepare it in advance for this reason\\n      great care is taken to keep the paper secret\\n\\n      today about three oclock the proofs of this paper arrived\\n      from the printers the exercise consists of half a chapter of\\n      thucydides i had to read it over carefully as the text must be\\n      absolutely correct at fourthirty my task was not yet completed\\n      i had however promised to take tea in a friends rooms so i\\n      left the proof upon my desk i was absent rather more than an\\n      hour\\n\\n      you are aware mr holmes that our college doors are doublea\\n      green baize one within and a heavy oak one without as i\\n      approached my outer door i was amazed to see a key in it for an\\n      instant i imagined that i had left my own there but on feeling\\n      in my pocket i found that it was all right the only duplicate\\n      which existed so far as i knew was that which belonged to my\\n      servant bannistera man who has looked after my room for ten\\n      years and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion i found\\n      that the key was indeed his that he had entered my room to know\\n      if i wanted tea and that he had very carelessly left the key in\\n      the door when he came out his visit to my room must have been\\n      within a very few minutes of my leaving it his forgetfulness\\n      about the key would have mattered little upon any other occasion\\n      but on this one day it has produced the most deplorable\\n      consequences\\n\\n      the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had\\n      rummaged among my papers the proof was in three long slips i\\n      had left them all together now i found that one of them was\\n      lying on the floor one was on the side table near the window\\n      and the third was where i had left it\\n\\n      holmes stirred for the first time\\n\\n      the first page on the floor the second in the window the third\\n      where you left it said he\\n\\n      exactly mr holmes you amaze me how could you possibly know\\n      that\\n\\n      pray continue your very interesting statement\\n\\n      for an instant i imagined that bannister had taken the\\n      unpardonable liberty of examining my papers he denied it\\n      however with the utmost earnestness and i am convinced that he\\n      was speaking the truth the alternative was that someone passing\\n      had observed the key in the door had known that i was out and\\n      had entered to look at the papers a large sum of money is at\\n      stake for the scholarship is a very valuable one and an\\n      unscrupulous man might very well run a risk in order to gain an\\n      advantage over his fellows\\n\\n      bannister was very much upset by the incident he had nearly\\n      fainted when we found that the papers had undoubtedly been\\n      tampered with i gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed\\n      in a chair while i made a most careful examination of the room\\n      i soon saw that the intruder had left other traces of his\\n      presence besides the rumpled papers on the table in the window\\n      were several shreds from a pencil which had been sharpened a\\n      broken tip of lead was lying there also evidently the rascal had\\n      copied the paper in a great hurry had broken his pencil and had\\n      been compelled to put a fresh point to it\\n\\n      excellent said holmes who was recovering his goodhumour as\\n      his attention became more engrossed by the case fortune has\\n      been your friend\\n\\n      this was not all i have a new writingtable with a fine surface\\n      of red leather i am prepared to swear and so is bannister that\\n      it was smooth and unstained now i found a clean cut in it about\\n      three inches longnot a mere scratch but a positive cut not\\n      only this but on the table i found a small ball of black dough\\n      or clay with specks of something which looks like sawdust in it\\n      i am convinced that these marks were left by the man who rifled\\n      the papers there were no footmarks and no other evidence as to\\n      his identity i was at my wits end when suddenly the happy\\n      thought occurred to me that you were in the town and i came\\n      straight round to put the matter into your hands do help me mr\\n      holmes you see my dilemma either i must find the man or else\\n      the examination must be postponed until fresh papers are\\n      prepared and since this cannot be done without explanation\\n      there will ensue a hideous scandal which will throw a cloud not\\n      only on the college but on the university above all things i\\n      desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly\\n\\n      i shall be happy to look into it and to give you such advice as\\n      i can said holmes rising and putting on his overcoat the\\n      case is not entirely devoid of interest had anyone visited you\\n      in your room after the papers came to you\\n\\n      yes young daulat ras an indian student who lives on the same\\n      stair came in to ask me some particulars about the examination\\n\\n      for which he was entered\\n\\n      yes\\n\\n      and the papers were on your table\\n\\n      to the best of my belief they were rolled up\\n\\n      but might be recognized as proofs\\n\\n      possibly\\n\\n      no one else in your room\\n\\n      no\\n\\n      did anyone know that these proofs would be there\\n\\n      no one save the printer\\n\\n      did this man bannister know\\n\\n      no certainly not no one knew\\n\\n      where is bannister now\\n\\n      he was very ill poor fellow i left him collapsed in the chair\\n      i was in such a hurry to come to you\\n\\n      you left your door open\\n\\n      i locked up the papers first\\n\\n      then it amounts to this mr soames that unless the indian\\n      student recognized the roll as being proofs the man who tampered\\n      with them came upon them accidentally without knowing that they\\n      were there\\n\\n      so it seems to me\\n\\n      holmes gave an enigmatic smile\\n\\n      well said he let us go round not one of your cases\\n      watsonmental not physical all right come if you want to now\\n      mr soamesat your disposal\\n\\n      the sittingroom of our client opened by a long low latticed\\n      window on to the ancient lichentinted court of the old college\\n      a gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase on the ground\\n      floor was the tutors room above were three students one on\\n      each story it was already twilight when we reached the scene of\\n      our problem holmes halted and looked earnestly at the window\\n      then he approached it and standing on tiptoe with his neck\\n      craned he looked into the room\\n\\n      he must have entered through the door there is no opening\\n      except the one pane said our learned guide\\n\\n      dear me said holmes and he smiled in a singular way as he\\n      glanced at our companion well if there is nothing to be\\n      learned here we had best go inside\\n\\n      the lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his\\n      room we stood at the entrance while holmes made an examination\\n      of the carpet\\n\\n      i am afraid there are no signs here said he one could hardly\\n      hope for any upon so dry a day your servant seems to have quite\\n      recovered you left him in a chair you say which chair\\n\\n      by the window there\\n\\n      i see near this little table you can come in now i have\\n      finished with the carpet let us take the little table first of\\n      course what has happened is very clear the man entered and took\\n      the papers sheet by sheet from the central table he carried\\n      them over to the window table because from there he could see if\\n      you came across the courtyard and so could effect an escape\\n\\n      as a matter of fact he could not said soames for i entered\\n      by the side door\\n\\n      ah thats good well anyhow that was in his mind let me see\\n      the three strips no finger impressionsno well he carried over\\n      this one first and he copied it how long would it take him to\\n      do that using every possible contraction a quarter of an hour\\n      not less then he tossed it down and seized the next he was in\\n      the midst of that when your return caused him to make a very\\n      hurried retreatvery hurried since he had not time to replace\\n      the papers which would tell you that he had been there you were\\n      not aware of any hurrying feet on the stair as you entered the\\n      outer door\\n\\n      no i cant say i was\\n\\n      well he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil and had\\n      as you observe to sharpen it again this is of interest watson\\n      the pencil was not an ordinary one it was above the usual size\\n      with a soft lead the outer colour was dark blue the makers\\n      name was printed in silver lettering and the piece remaining is\\n      only about an inch and a half long look for such a pencil mr\\n      soames and you have got your man when i add that he possesses a\\n      large and very blunt knife you have an additional aid\\n\\n      mr soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information\\n      i can follow the other points said he but really in this\\n      matter of the length\\n\\n      holmes held out a small chip with the letters nn and a space of\\n      clear wood after them\\n\\n      you see\\n\\n      no i fear that even now\\n\\n      watson i have always done you an injustice there are others\\n      what could this nn be it is at the end of a word you are aware\\n      that johann faber is the most common makers name is it not\\n      clear that there is just as much of the pencil left as usually\\n      follows the johann he held the small table sideways to the\\n      electric light i was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote\\n      was thin some trace of it might come through upon this polished\\n      surface no i see nothing i dont think there is anything more\\n      to be learned here now for the central table this small pellet\\n      is i presume the black doughy mass you spoke of roughly\\n      pyramidal in shape and hollowed out i perceive as you say\\n      there appear to be grains of sawdust in it dear me this is very\\n      interesting and the cuta positive tear i see it began with a\\n      thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole i am much indebted to\\n      you for directing my attention to this case mr soames where\\n      does that door lead to\\n\\n      to my bedroom\\n\\n      have you been in it since your adventure\\n\\n      no i came straight away for you\\n\\n      i should like to have a glance round what a charming\\n      oldfashioned room perhaps you will kindly wait a minute until\\n      i have examined the floor no i see nothing what about this\\n      curtain you hang your clothes behind it if anyone were forced\\n      to conceal himself in this room he must do it there since the\\n      bed is too low and the wardrobe too shallow no one there i\\n      suppose\\n\\n      as holmes drew the curtain i was aware from some little rigidity\\n      and alertness of his attitude that he was prepared for an\\n      emergency as a matter of fact the drawn curtain disclosed\\n      nothing but three or four suits of clothes hanging from a line of\\n      pegs holmes turned away and stooped suddenly to the floor\\n\\n      halloa whats this said he\\n\\n      it was a small pyramid of black puttylike stuff exactly like\\n      the one upon the table of the study holmes held it out on his\\n      open palm in the glare of the electric light\\n\\n      your visitor seems to have left traces in your bedroom as well\\n      as in your sittingroom mr soames\\n\\n      what could he have wanted there\\n\\n      i think it is clear enough you came back by an unexpected way\\n      and so he had no warning until you were at the very door what\\n      could he do he caught up everything which would betray him and\\n      he rushed into your bedroom to conceal himself\\n\\n      good gracious mr holmes do you mean to tell me that all the\\n      time i was talking to bannister in this room we had the man\\n      prisoner if we had only known it\\n\\n      so i read it\\n\\n      surely there is another alternative mr holmes i dont know\\n      whether you observed my bedroom window\\n\\n      latticepaned lead framework three separate windows one\\n      swinging on hinge and large enough to admit a man\\n\\n      exactly and it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as to\\n      be partly invisible the man might have effected his entrance\\n      there left traces as he passed through the bedroom and finally\\n      finding the door open have escaped that way\\n\\n      holmes shook his head impatiently\\n\\n      let us be practical said he i understand you to say that\\n      there are three students who use this stair and are in the habit\\n      of passing your door\\n\\n      yes there are\\n\\n      and they are all in for this examination\\n\\n      yes\\n\\n      have you any reason to suspect any one of them more than the\\n      others\\n\\n      soames hesitated\\n\\n      it is a very delicate question said he one hardly likes to\\n      throw suspicion where there are no proofs\\n\\n      let us hear the suspicions i will look after the proofs\\n\\n      i will tell you then in a few words the character of the three\\n      men who inhabit these rooms the lower of the three is gilchrist\\n      a fine scholar and athlete plays in the rugby team and the\\n      cricket team for the college and got his blue for the hurdles\\n      and the long jump he is a fine manly fellow his father was the\\n      notorious sir jabez gilchrist who ruined himself on the turf my\\n      scholar has been left very poor but he is hardworking and\\n      industrious he will do well\\n\\n      the second floor is inhabited by daulat ras the indian he is a\\n      quiet inscrutable fellow as most of those indians are he is\\n      well up in his work though his greek is his weak subject he is\\n      steady and methodical\\n\\n      the top floor belongs to miles mclaren he is a brilliant fellow\\n      when he chooses to workone of the brightest intellects of the\\n      university but he is wayward dissipated and unprincipled he\\n      was nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first year he has\\n      been idling all this term and he must look forward with dread to\\n      the examination\\n\\n      then it is he whom you suspect\\n\\n      i dare not go so far as that but of the three he is perhaps\\n      the least unlikely\\n\\n      exactly now mr soames let us have a look at your servant\\n      bannister\\n\\n      he was a little whitefaced cleanshaven grizzlyhaired fellow\\n      of fifty he was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of\\n      the quiet routine of his life his plump face was twitching with\\n      his nervousness and his fingers could not keep still\\n\\n      we are investigating this unhappy business bannister said his\\n      master\\n\\n      yes sir\\n\\n      i understand said holmes that you left your key in the\\n      door\\n\\n      yes sir\\n\\n      was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the\\n      very day when there were these papers inside\\n\\n      it was most unfortunate sir but i have occasionally done the\\n      same thing at other times\\n\\n      when did you enter the room\\n\\n      it was about halfpast four that is mr soames tea time\\n\\n      how long did you stay\\n\\n      when i saw that he was absent i withdrew at once\\n\\n      did you look at these papers on the table\\n\\n      no sircertainly not\\n\\n      how came you to leave the key in the door\\n\\n      i had the teatray in my hand i thought i would come back for\\n      the key then i forgot\\n\\n      has the outer door a spring lock\\n\\n      no sir\\n\\n      then it was open all the time\\n\\n      yes sir\\n\\n      anyone in the room could get out\\n\\n      yes sir\\n\\n      when mr soames returned and called for you you were very much\\n      disturbed\\n\\n      yes sir such a thing has never happened during the many years\\n      that i have been here i nearly fainted sir\\n\\n      so i understand where were you when you began to feel bad\\n\\n      where was i sir why here near the door\\n\\n      that is singular because you sat down in that chair over yonder\\n      near the corner why did you pass these other chairs\\n\\n      i dont know sir it didnt matter to me where i sat\\n\\n      i really dont think he knew much about it mr holmes he was\\n      looking very badquite ghastly\\n\\n      you stayed here when your master left\\n\\n      only for a minute or so then i locked the door and went to my\\n      room\\n\\n      whom do you suspect\\n\\n      oh i would not venture to say sir i dont believe there is\\n      any gentleman in this university who is capable of profiting by\\n      such an action no sir ill not believe it\\n\\n      thank you that will do said holmes oh one more word you\\n      have not mentioned to any of the three gentlemen whom you attend\\n      that anything is amiss\\n\\n      no sirnot a word\\n\\n      you havent seen any of them\\n\\n      no sir\\n\\n      very good now mr soames we will take a walk in the\\n      quadrangle if you please\\n\\n      three yellow squares of light shone above us in the gathering\\n      gloom\\n\\n      your three birds are all in their nests said holmes looking\\n      up halloa whats that one of them seems restless enough\\n\\n      it was the indian whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon\\n      his blind he was pacing swiftly up and down his room\\n\\n      i should like to have a peep at each of them said holmes is\\n      it possible\\n\\n      no difficulty in the world soames answered this set of rooms\\n      is quite the oldest in the college and it is not unusual for\\n      visitors to go over them come along and i will personally\\n      conduct you\\n\\n      no names please said holmes as we knocked at gilchrists\\n      door a tall flaxenhaired slim young fellow opened it and\\n      made us welcome when he understood our errand there were some\\n      really curious pieces of medival domestic architecture within\\n      holmes was so charmed with one of them that he insisted on\\n      drawing it in his notebook broke his pencil had to borrow one\\n      from our host and finally borrowed a knife to sharpen his own\\n      the same curious accident happened to him in the rooms of the\\n      indiana silent little hooknosed fellow who eyed us askance\\n      and was obviously glad when holmess architectural studies had\\n      come to an end i could not see that in either case holmes had\\n      come upon the clue for which he was searching only at the third\\n      did our visit prove abortive the outer door would not open to\\n      our knock and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad\\n      language came from behind it i dont care who you are you can\\n      go to blazes roared the angry voice tomorrows the exam and\\n      i wont be drawn by anyone\\n\\n      a rude fellow said our guide flushing with anger as we\\n      withdrew down the stair of course he did not realize that it\\n      was i who was knocking but none the less his conduct was very\\n      uncourteous and indeed under the circumstances rather\\n      suspicious\\n\\n      holmess response was a curious one\\n\\n      can you tell me his exact height he asked\\n\\n      really mr holmes i cannot undertake to say he is taller than\\n      the indian not so tall as gilchrist i suppose five foot six\\n      would be about it\\n\\n      that is very important said holmes and now mr soames i\\n      wish you goodnight\\n\\n      our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay good\\n      gracious mr holmes you are surely not going to leave me in\\n      this abrupt fashion you dont seem to realize the position\\n      tomorrow is the examination i must take some definite action\\n      tonight i cannot allow the examination to be held if one of the\\n      papers has been tampered with the situation must be faced\\n\\n      you must leave it as it is i shall drop round early tomorrow\\n      morning and chat the matter over it is possible that i may be in\\n      a position then to indicate some course of action meanwhile you\\n      change nothingnothing at all\\n\\n      very good mr holmes\\n\\n      you can be perfectly easy in your mind we shall certainly find\\n      some way out of your difficulties i will take the black clay\\n      with me also the pencil cuttings goodbye\\n\\n      when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again\\n      looked up at the windows the indian still paced his room the\\n      others were invisible\\n\\n      well watson what do you think of it holmes asked as we came\\n      out into the main street quite a little parlour gamesort of\\n      threecard trick is it not there are your three men it must be\\n      one of them you take your choice which is yours\\n\\n      the foulmouthed fellow at the top he is the one with the worst\\n      record and yet that indian was a sly fellow also why should he\\n      be pacing his room all the time\\n\\n      there is nothing in that many men do it when they are trying to\\n      learn anything by heart\\n\\n      he looked at us in a queer way\\n\\n      so would you if a flock of strangers came in on you when you\\n      were preparing for an examination next day and every moment was\\n      of value no i see nothing in that pencils too and knivesall\\n      was satisfactory but that fellow does puzzle me\\n\\n      who\\n\\n      why bannister the servant whats his game in the matter\\n\\n      he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man\\n\\n      so he did me thats the puzzling part why should a perfectly\\n      honest manwell well heres a large stationers we shall begin\\n      our researches here\\n\\n      there were only four stationers of any consequences in the town\\n      and at each holmes produced his pencil chips and bid high for a\\n      duplicate all were agreed that one could be ordered but that it\\n      was not a usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in\\n      stock my friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure\\n      but shrugged his shoulders in halfhumorous resignation\\n\\n      no good my dear watson this the best and only final clue has\\n      run to nothing but indeed i have little doubt that we can\\n      build up a sufficient case without it by jove my dear fellow\\n      it is nearly nine and the landlady babbled of green peas at\\n      seventhirty what with your eternal tobacco watson and your\\n      irregularity at meals i expect that you will get notice to quit\\n      and that i shall share your downfallnot however before we have\\n      solved the problem of the nervous tutor the careless servant\\n      and the three enterprising students\\n\\n      holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day though he\\n      sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner at\\n      eight in the morning he came into my room just as i finished my\\n      toilet\\n\\n      well watson said he it is time we went down to st lukes\\n      can you do without breakfast\\n\\n      certainly\\n\\n      soames will be in a dreadful fidget until we are able to tell\\n      him something positive\\n\\n      have you anything positive to tell him\\n\\n      i think so\\n\\n      you have formed a conclusion\\n\\n      yes my dear watson i have solved the mystery\\n\\n      but what fresh evidence could you have got\\n\\n      aha it is not for nothing that i have turned myself out of bed\\n      at the untimely hour of six i have put in two hours hard work\\n      and covered at least five miles with something to show for it\\n      look at that\\n\\n      he held out his hand on the palm were three little pyramids of\\n      black doughy clay\\n\\n      why holmes you had only two yesterday\\n\\n      and one more this morning it is a fair argument that wherever\\n      no  came from is also the source of nos  and  eh watson\\n      well come along and put friend soames out of his pain\\n\\n      the unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable\\n      agitation when we found him in his chambers in a few hours the\\n      examination would commence and he was still in the dilemma\\n      between making the facts public and allowing the culprit to\\n      compete for the valuable scholarship he could hardly stand still\\n      so great was his mental agitation and he ran towards holmes with\\n      two eager hands outstretched\\n\\n      thank heaven that you have come i feared that you had given it\\n      up in despair what am i to do shall the examination proceed\\n\\n      yes let it proceed by all means\\n\\n      but this rascal\\n\\n      he shall not compete\\n\\n      you know him\\n\\n      i think so if this matter is not to become public we must give\\n      ourselves certain powers and resolve ourselves into a small\\n      private courtmartial you there if you please soames watson\\n      you here ill take the armchair in the middle i think that we\\n      are now sufficiently imposing to strike terror into a guilty\\n      breast kindly ring the bell\\n\\n      bannister entered and shrank back in evident surprise and fear\\n      at our judicial appearance\\n\\n      you will kindly close the door said holmes now bannister\\n      will you please tell us the truth about yesterdays incident\\n\\n      the man turned white to the roots of his hair\\n\\n      i have told you everything sir\\n\\n      nothing to add\\n\\n      nothing at all sir\\n\\n      well then i must make some suggestions to you when you sat\\n      down on that chair yesterday did you do so in order to conceal\\n      some object which would have shown who had been in the room\\n\\n      bannisters face was ghastly\\n\\n      no sir certainly not\\n\\n      it is only a suggestion said holmes suavely i frankly admit\\n      that i am unable to prove it but it seems probable enough since\\n      the moment that mr soamess back was turned you released the\\n      man who was hiding in that bedroom\\n\\n      bannister licked his dry lips\\n\\n      there was no man sir\\n\\n      ah thats a pity bannister up to now you may have spoken the\\n      truth but now i know that you have lied\\n\\n      the mans face set in sullen defiance\\n\\n      there was no man sir\\n\\n      come come bannister\\n\\n      no sir there was no one\\n\\n      in that case you can give us no further information would you\\n      please remain in the room stand over there near the bedroom\\n      door now soames i am going to ask you to have the great\\n      kindness to go up to the room of young gilchrist and to ask him\\n      to step down into yours\\n\\n      an instant later the tutor returned bringing with him the\\n      student he was a fine figure of a man tall lithe and agile\\n      with a springy step and a pleasant open face his troubled blue\\n      eyes glanced at each of us and finally rested with an expression\\n      of blank dismay upon bannister in the farther corner\\n\\n      just close the door said holmes now mr gilchrist we are\\n      all quite alone here and no one need ever know one word of what\\n      passes between us we can be perfectly frank with each other we\\n      want to know mr gilchrist how you an honourable man ever\\n      came to commit such an action as that of yesterday\\n\\n      the unfortunate young man staggered back and cast a look full of\\n      horror and reproach at bannister\\n\\n      no no mr gilchrist sir i never said a wordnever one word\\n      cried the servant\\n\\n      no but you have now said holmes now sir you must see that\\n      after bannisters words your position is hopeless and that your\\n      only chance lies in a frank confession\\n\\n      for a moment gilchrist with upraised hand tried to control his\\n      writhing features the next he had thrown himself on his knees\\n      beside the table and burying his face in his hands he had burst\\n      into a storm of passionate sobbing\\n\\n      come come said holmes kindly it is human to err and at\\n      least no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal perhaps\\n      it would be easier for you if i were to tell mr soames what\\n      occurred and you can check me where i am wrong shall i do so\\n      well well dont trouble to answer listen and see that i do\\n      you no injustice\\n\\n      from the moment mr soames that you said to me that no one\\n      not even bannister could have told that the papers were in your\\n      room the case began to take a definite shape in my mind the\\n      printer one could of course dismiss he could examine the\\n      papers in his own office the indian i also thought nothing of\\n      if the proofs were in a roll he could not possibly know what\\n      they were on the other hand it seemed an unthinkable\\n      coincidence that a man should dare to enter the room and that by\\n      chance on that very day the papers were on the table i dismissed\\n      that the man who entered knew that the papers were there how\\n      did he know\\n\\n      when i approached your room i examined the window you amused\\n      me by supposing that i was contemplating the possibility of\\n      someone having in broad daylight under the eyes of all these\\n      opposite rooms forced himself through it such an idea was\\n      absurd i was measuring how tall a man would need to be in order\\n      to see as he passed what papers were on the central table i am\\n      six feet high and i could do it with an effort no one less than\\n      that would have a chance already you see i had reason to think\\n      that if one of your three students was a man of unusual height\\n      he was the most worth watching of the three\\n\\n      i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the\\n      suggestions of the side table of the centre table i could make\\n      nothing until in your description of gilchrist you mentioned\\n      that he was a longdistance jumper then the whole thing came to\\n      me in an instant and i only needed certain corroborative proofs\\n      which i speedily obtained\\n\\n      what happened was this this young fellow had employed his\\n      afternoon at the athletic grounds where he had been practising\\n      the jump he returned carrying his jumpingshoes which are\\n      provided as you are aware with several sharp spikes as he\\n      passed your window he saw by means of his great height these\\n      proofs upon your table and conjectured what they were no harm\\n      would have been done had it not been that as he passed your\\n      door he perceived the key which had been left by the\\n      carelessness of your servant a sudden impulse came over him to\\n      enter and see if they were indeed the proofs it was not a\\n      dangerous exploit for he could always pretend that he had simply\\n      looked in to ask a question\\n\\n      well when he saw that they were indeed the proofs it was then\\n      that he yielded to temptation he put his shoes on the table\\n      what was it you put on that chair near the window\\n\\n      gloves said the young man\\n\\n      holmes looked triumphantly at bannister he put his gloves on\\n      the chair and he took the proofs sheet by sheet to copy them\\n      he thought the tutor must return by the main gate and that he\\n      would see him as we know he came back by the side gate\\n      suddenly he heard him at the very door there was no possible\\n      escape he forgot his gloves but he caught up his shoes and\\n      darted into the bedroom you observe that the scratch on that\\n      table is slight at one side but deepens in the direction of the\\n      bedroom door that in itself is enough to show us that the shoe\\n      had been drawn in that direction and that the culprit had taken\\n      refuge there the earth round the spike had been left on the\\n      table and a second sample was loosened and fell in the bedroom\\n      i may add that i walked out to the athletic grounds this morning\\n      saw that tenacious black clay is used in the jumpingpit and\\n      carried away a specimen of it together with some of the fine tan\\n      or sawdust which is strewn over it to prevent the athlete from\\n      slipping have i told the truth mr gilchrist\\n\\n      the student had drawn himself erect\\n\\n      yes sir it is true said he\\n\\n      good heavens have you nothing to add cried soames\\n\\n      yes sir i have but the shock of this disgraceful exposure has\\n      bewildered me i have a letter here mr soames which i wrote to\\n      you early this morning in the middle of a restless night it was\\n      before i knew that my sin had found me out here it is sir you\\n      will see that i have said i have determined not to go in for\\n      the examination i have been offered a commission in the\\n      rhodesian police and i am going out to south africa at once\\n\\n      i am indeed pleased to hear that you did not intend to profit by\\n      your unfair advantage said soames but why did you change your\\n      purpose\\n\\n      gilchrist pointed to bannister\\n\\n      there is the man who set me in the right path said he\\n\\n      come now bannister said holmes it will be clear to you\\n      from what i have said that only you could have let this young\\n      man out since you were left in the room and must have locked\\n      the door when you went out as to his escaping by that window it\\n      was incredible can you not clear up the last point in this\\n      mystery and tell us the reasons for your action\\n\\n      it was simple enough sir if you only had known but with all\\n      your cleverness it was impossible that you could know time was\\n      sir when i was butler to old sir jabez gilchrist this young\\n      gentlemans father when he was ruined i came to the college as\\n      servant but i never forgot my old employer because he was down\\n      in the world i watched his son all i could for the sake of the\\n      old days well sir when i came into this room yesterday when\\n      the alarm was given the very first thing i saw was mr\\n      gilchrists tan gloves alying in that chair i knew those gloves\\n      well and i understood their message if mr soames saw them the\\n      game was up i flopped down into that chair and nothing would\\n      budge me until mr soames he went for you then out came my poor\\n      young master whom i had dandled on my knee and confessed it all\\n      to me wasnt it natural sir that i should save him and wasnt\\n      it natural also that i should try to speak to him as his dead\\n      father would have done and make him understand that he could not\\n      profit by such a deed could you blame me sir\\n\\n      no indeed said holmes heartily springing to his feet\\n      well soames i think we have cleared your little problem up\\n      and our breakfast awaits us at home come watson as to you\\n      sir i trust that a bright future awaits you in rhodesia for\\n      once you have fallen low let us see in the future how high you\\n      can rise\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe adventure of the golden pincenez\\n\\n\\n      when i look at the three massive manuscript volumes which contain\\n      our work for the year  i confess that it is very difficult\\n      for me out of such a wealth of material to select the cases\\n      which are most interesting in themselves and at the same time\\n      most conducive to a display of those peculiar powers for which my\\n      friend was famous as i turn over the pages i see my notes upon\\n      the repulsive story of the red leech and the terrible death of\\n      crosby the banker here also i find an account of the addleton\\n      tragedy and the singular contents of the ancient british barrow\\n      the famous smithmortimer succession case comes also within this\\n      period and so does the tracking and arrest of huret the\\n      boulevard assassinan exploit which won for holmes an autograph\\n      letter of thanks from the french president and the order of the\\n      legion of honour each of these would furnish a narrative but on\\n      the whole i am of opinion that none of them unites so many\\n      singular points of interest as the episode of yoxley old place\\n      which includes not only the lamentable death of young willoughby\\n      smith but also those subsequent developments which threw so\\n      curious a light upon the causes of the crime\\n\\n      it was a wild tempestuous night towards the close of november\\n      holmes and i sat together in silence all the evening he engaged\\n      with a powerful lens deciphering the remains of the original\\n      inscription upon a palimpsest i deep in a recent treatise upon\\n      surgery outside the wind howled down baker street while the\\n      rain beat fiercely against the windows it was strange there in\\n      the very depths of the town with ten miles of mans handiwork on\\n      every side of us to feel the iron grip of nature and to be\\n      conscious that to the huge elemental forces all london was no\\n      more than the molehills that dot the fields i walked to the\\n      window and looked out on the deserted street the occasional\\n      lamps gleamed on the expanse of muddy road and shining pavement\\n      a single cab was splashing its way from the oxford street end\\n\\n      well watson its as well we have not to turn out tonight\\n      said holmes laying aside his lens and rolling up the palimpsest\\n      ive done enough for one sitting it is trying work for the\\n      eyes so far as i can make out it is nothing more exciting than\\n      an abbeys accounts dating from the second half of the fifteenth\\n      century halloa halloa halloa whats this\\n\\n      amid the droning of the wind there had come the stamping of a\\n      horses hoofs and the long grind of a wheel as it rasped against\\n      the curb the cab which i had seen had pulled up at our door\\n\\n      what can he want i ejaculated as a man stepped out of it\\n\\n      want he wants us and we my poor watson want overcoats and\\n      cravats and goloshes and every aid that man ever invented to\\n      fight the weather wait a bit though theres the cab off again\\n      theres hope yet hed have kept it if he had wanted us to come\\n      run down my dear fellow and open the door for all virtuous\\n      folk have been long in bed\\n\\n      when the light of the hall lamp fell upon our midnight visitor i\\n      had no difficulty in recognizing him it was young stanley\\n      hopkins a promising detective in whose career holmes had\\n      several times shown a very practical interest\\n\\n      is he in he asked eagerly\\n\\n      come up my dear sir said holmess voice from above i hope\\n      you have no designs upon us such a night as this\\n\\n      the detective mounted the stairs and our lamp gleamed upon his\\n      shining waterproof i helped him out of it while holmes knocked\\n      a blaze out of the logs in the grate\\n\\n      now my dear hopkins draw up and warm your toes said he\\n      heres a cigar and the doctor has a prescription containing hot\\n      water and a lemon which is good medicine on a night like this\\n      it must be something important which has brought you out in such\\n      a gale\\n\\n      it is indeed mr holmes ive had a bustling afternoon i\\n      promise you did you see anything of the yoxley case in the\\n      latest editions\\n\\n      ive seen nothing later than the fifteenth century today\\n\\n      well it was only a paragraph and all wrong at that so you\\n      have not missed anything i havent let the grass grow under my\\n      feet its down in kent seven miles from chatham and three from\\n      the railway line i was wired for at  reached yoxley old\\n      place at  conducted my investigation was back at charing cross\\n      by the last train and straight to you by cab\\n\\n      which means i suppose that you are not quite clear about your\\n      case\\n\\n      it means that i can make neither head nor tail of it so far as\\n      i can see it is just as tangled a business as ever i handled\\n      and yet at first it seemed so simple that one couldnt go wrong\\n      theres no motive mr holmes thats what bothers mei cant put\\n      my hand on a motive heres a man deadtheres no denying\\n      thatbut so far as i can see no reason on earth why anyone\\n      should wish him harm\\n\\n      holmes lit his cigar and leaned back in his chair\\n\\n      let us hear about it said he\\n\\n      ive got my facts pretty clear said stanley hopkins all i\\n      want now is to know what they all mean the story so far as i\\n      can make it out is like this some years ago this country house\\n      yoxley old place was taken by an elderly man who gave the name\\n      of professor coram he was an invalid keeping his bed half the\\n      time and the other half hobbling round the house with a stick or\\n      being pushed about the grounds by the gardener in a bath chair\\n      he was well liked by the few neighbours who called upon him and\\n      he has the reputation down there of being a very learned man his\\n      household used to consist of an elderly housekeeper mrs marker\\n      and of a maid susan tarlton these have both been with him since\\n      his arrival and they seem to be women of excellent character\\n      the professor is writing a learned book and he found it\\n      necessary about a year ago to engage a secretary the first two\\n      that he tried were not successes but the third mr willoughby\\n      smith a very young man straight from the university seems to\\n      have been just what his employer wanted his work consisted in\\n      writing all the morning to the professors dictation and he\\n      usually spent the evening in hunting up references and passages\\n      which bore upon the next days work this willoughby smith has\\n      nothing against him either as a boy at uppingham or as a young\\n      man at cambridge i have seen his testimonials and from the\\n      first he was a decent quiet hardworking fellow with no weak\\n      spot in him at all and yet this is the lad who has met his death\\n      this morning in the professors study under circumstances which\\n      can point only to murder\\n\\n      the wind howled and screamed at the windows holmes and i drew\\n      closer to the fire while the young inspector slowly and point by\\n      point developed his singular narrative\\n\\n      if you were to search all england said he i dont suppose\\n      you could find a household more selfcontained or freer from\\n      outside influences whole weeks would pass and not one of them\\n      go past the garden gate the professor was buried in his work and\\n      existed for nothing else young smith knew nobody in the\\n      neighbourhood and lived very much as his employer did the two\\n      women had nothing to take them from the house mortimer the\\n      gardener who wheels the bath chair is an army pensioneran old\\n      crimean man of excellent character he does not live in the\\n      house but in a threeroomed cottage at the other end of the\\n      garden those are the only people that you would find within the\\n      grounds of yoxley old place at the same time the gate of the\\n      garden is a hundred yards from the main london to chatham road\\n      it opens with a latch and there is nothing to prevent anyone\\n      from walking in\\n\\n      now i will give you the evidence of susan tarlton who is the\\n      only person who can say anything positive about the matter it\\n      was in the forenoon between eleven and twelve she was engaged\\n      at the moment in hanging some curtains in the upstairs front\\n      bedroom professor coram was still in bed for when the weather\\n      is bad he seldom rises before midday the housekeeper was busied\\n      with some work in the back of the house willoughby smith had\\n      been in his bedroom which he uses as a sittingroom but the\\n      maid heard him at that moment pass along the passage and descend\\n      to the study immediately below her she did not see him but she\\n      says that she could not be mistaken in his quick firm tread she\\n      did not hear the study door close but a minute or so later there\\n      was a dreadful cry in the room below it was a wild hoarse\\n      scream so strange and unnatural that it might have come either\\n      from a man or a woman at the same instant there was a heavy\\n      thud which shook the old house and then all was silence the\\n      maid stood petrified for a moment and then recovering her\\n      courage she ran downstairs the study door was shut and she\\n      opened it inside young mr willoughby smith was stretched upon\\n      the floor at first she could see no injury but as she tried to\\n      raise him she saw that blood was pouring from the underside of\\n      his neck it was pierced by a very small but very deep wound\\n      which had divided the carotid artery the instrument with which\\n      the injury had been inflicted lay upon the carpet beside him it\\n      was one of those small sealingwax knives to be found on\\n      oldfashioned writingtables with an ivory handle and a stiff\\n      blade it was part of the fittings of the professors own desk\\n\\n      at first the maid thought that young smith was already dead but\\n      on pouring some water from the carafe over his forehead he opened\\n      his eyes for an instant the professor he murmuredit was\\n      she the maid is prepared to swear that those were the exact\\n      words he tried desperately to say something else and he held\\n      his right hand up in the air then he fell back dead\\n\\n      in the meantime the housekeeper had also arrived upon the scene\\n      but she was just too late to catch the young mans dying words\\n      leaving susan with the body she hurried to the professors room\\n      he was sitting up in bed horribly agitated for he had heard\\n      enough to convince him that something terrible had occurred mrs\\n      marker is prepared to swear that the professor was still in his\\n      nightclothes and indeed it was impossible for him to dress\\n      without the help of mortimer whose orders were to come at twelve\\n      oclock the professor declares that he heard the distant cry\\n      but that he knows nothing more he can give no explanation of the\\n      young mans last words the professorit was she but imagines\\n      that they were the outcome of delirium he believes that\\n      willoughby smith had not an enemy in the world and can give no\\n      reason for the crime his first action was to send mortimer the\\n      gardener for the local police a little later the chief\\n      constable sent for me nothing was moved before i got there and\\n      strict orders were given that no one should walk upon the paths\\n      leading to the house it was a splendid chance of putting your\\n      theories into practice mr sherlock holmes there was really\\n      nothing wanting\\n\\n      except mr sherlock holmes said my companion with a somewhat\\n      bitter smile well let us hear about it what sort of a job did\\n      you make of it\\n\\n      i must ask you first mr holmes to glance at this rough plan\\n      which will give you a general idea of the position of the\\n      professors study and the various points of the case it will\\n      help you in following my investigation\\n\\n      he unfolded the rough chart which i here reproduce and he laid\\n      it across holmess knee i rose and standing behind holmes\\n      studied it over his shoulder\\n\\n      professorsstudy\\n\\n      it is very rough of course and it only deals with the points\\n      which seem to me to be essential all the rest you will see later\\n      for yourself now first of all presuming that the assassin\\n      entered the house how did he or she come in undoubtedly by the\\n      garden path and the back door from which there is direct access\\n      to the study any other way would have been exceedingly\\n      complicated the escape must have also been made along that line\\n      for of the two other exits from the room one was blocked by susan\\n      as she ran downstairs and the other leads straight to the\\n      professors bedroom i therefore directed my attention at once to\\n      the garden path which was saturated with recent rain and would\\n      certainly show any footmarks\\n\\n      my examination showed me that i was dealing with a cautious and\\n      expert criminal no footmarks were to be found on the path there\\n      could be no question however that someone had passed along the\\n      grass border which lines the path and that he had done so in\\n      order to avoid leaving a track i could not find anything in the\\n      nature of a distinct impression but the grass was trodden down\\n      and someone had undoubtedly passed it could only have been the\\n      murderer since neither the gardener nor anyone else had been\\n      there that morning and the rain had only begun during the\\n      night\\n\\n      one moment said holmes where does this path lead to\\n\\n      to the road\\n\\n      how long is it\\n\\n      a hundred yards or so\\n\\n      at the point where the path passes through the gate you could\\n      surely pick up the tracks\\n\\n      unfortunately the path was tiled at that point\\n\\n      well on the road itself\\n\\n      no it was all trodden into mire\\n\\n      tuttut well then these tracks upon the grass were they\\n      coming or going\\n\\n      it was impossible to say there was never any outline\\n\\n      a large foot or a small\\n\\n      you could not distinguish\\n\\n      holmes gave an ejaculation of impatience\\n\\n      it has been pouring rain and blowing a hurricane ever since\\n      said he it will be harder to read now than that palimpsest\\n      well well it cant be helped what did you do hopkins after\\n      you had made certain that you had made certain of nothing\\n\\n      i think i made certain of a good deal mr holmes i knew that\\n      someone had entered the house cautiously from without i next\\n      examined the corridor it is lined with cocoanut matting and had\\n      taken no impression of any kind this brought me into the study\\n      itself it is a scantily furnished room the main article is a\\n      large writingtable with a fixed bureau this bureau consists of\\n      a double column of drawers with a central small cupboard between\\n      them the drawers were open the cupboard locked the drawers it\\n      seems were always open and nothing of value was kept in them\\n      there were some papers of importance in the cupboard but there\\n      were no signs that this had been tampered with and the professor\\n      assures me that nothing was missing it is certain that no\\n      robbery has been committed\\n\\n      i come now to the body of the young man it was found near the\\n      bureau and just to the left of it as marked upon that chart\\n      the stab was on the right side of the neck and from behind\\n      forward so that it is almost impossible that it could have been\\n      selfinflicted\\n\\n      unless he fell upon the knife said holmes\\n\\n      exactly the idea crossed my mind but we found the knife some\\n      feet away from the body so that seems impossible then of\\n      course there are the mans own dying words and finally there\\n      was this very important piece of evidence which was found clasped\\n      in the dead mans right hand\\n\\n      from his pocket stanley hopkins drew a small paper packet he\\n      unfolded it and disclosed a golden pincenez with two broken\\n      ends of black silk cord dangling from the end of it willoughby\\n      smith had excellent sight he added there can be no question\\n      that this was snatched from the face or the person of the\\n      assassin\\n\\n      sherlock holmes took the glasses into his hand and examined them\\n      with the utmost attention and interest he held them on his nose\\n      endeavoured to read through them went to the window and stared\\n      up the street with them looked at them most minutely in the full\\n      light of the lamp and finally with a chuckle seated himself at\\n      the table and wrote a few lines upon a sheet of paper which he\\n      tossed across to stanley hopkins\\n\\n      thats the best i can do for you said he it may prove to be\\n      of some use\\n\\n      the astonished detective read the note aloud it ran as follows\\n\\n      wanted a woman of good address attired like a lady she has a\\n      remarkably thick nose with eyes which are set close upon either\\n      side of it she has a puckered forehead a peering expression\\n      and probably rounded shoulders there are indications that she\\n      has had recourse to an optician at least twice during the last\\n      few months as her glasses are of remarkable strength and as\\n      opticians are not very numerous there should be no difficulty in\\n      tracing her\\n\\n      holmes smiled at the astonishment of hopkins which must have\\n      been reflected upon my features surely my deductions are\\n      simplicity itself said he it would be difficult to name any\\n      articles which afford a finer field for inference than a pair of\\n      glasses especially so remarkable a pair as these that they\\n      belong to a woman i infer from their delicacy and also of\\n      course from the last words of the dying man as to her being a\\n      person of refinement and well dressed they are as you perceive\\n      handsomely mounted in solid gold and it is inconceivable that\\n      anyone who wore such glasses could be slatternly in other\\n      respects you will find that the clips are too wide for your\\n      nose showing that the ladys nose was very broad at the base\\n      this sort of nose is usually a short and coarse one but there is\\n      a sufficient number of exceptions to prevent me from being\\n      dogmatic or from insisting upon this point in my description my\\n      own face is a narrow one and yet i find that i cannot get my\\n      eyes into the centre nor near the centre of these glasses\\n      therefore the ladys eyes are set very near to the sides of the\\n      nose you will perceive watson that the glasses are concave and\\n      of unusual strength a lady whose vision has been so extremely\\n      contracted all her life is sure to have the physical\\n      characteristics of such vision which are seen in the forehead\\n      the eyelids and the shoulders\\n\\n      yes i said i can follow each of your arguments i confess\\n      however that i am unable to understand how you arrive at the\\n      double visit to the optician\\n\\n      holmes took the glasses in his hand\\n\\n      you will perceive he said that the clips are lined with tiny\\n      bands of cork to soften the pressure upon the nose one of these\\n      is discoloured and worn to some slight extent but the other is\\n      new evidently one has fallen off and been replaced i should\\n      judge that the older of them has not been there more than a few\\n      months they exactly correspond so i gather that the lady went\\n      back to the same establishment for the second\\n\\n      by george its marvellous cried hopkins in an ecstasy of\\n      admiration to think that i had all that evidence in my hand and\\n      never knew it i had intended however to go the round of the\\n      london opticians\\n\\n      of course you would meanwhile have you anything more to tell\\n      us about the case\\n\\n      nothing mr holmes i think that you know as much as i do\\n      nowprobably more we have had inquiries made as to any stranger\\n      seen on the country roads or at the railway station we have\\n      heard of none what beats me is the utter want of all object in\\n      the crime not a ghost of a motive can anyone suggest\\n\\n      ah there i am not in a position to help you but i suppose you\\n      want us to come out tomorrow\\n\\n      if it is not asking too much mr holmes theres a train from\\n      charing cross to chatham at six in the morning and we should be\\n      at yoxley old place between eight and nine\\n\\n      then we shall take it your case has certainly some features of\\n      great interest and i shall be delighted to look into it well\\n      its nearly one and we had best get a few hours sleep i\\n      daresay you can manage all right on the sofa in front of the\\n      fire ill light my spirit lamp and give you a cup of coffee\\n      before we start\\n\\n      the gale had blown itself out next day but it was a bitter\\n      morning when we started upon our journey we saw the cold winter\\n      sun rise over the dreary marshes of the thames and the long\\n      sullen reaches of the river which i shall ever associate with\\n      our pursuit of the andaman islander in the earlier days of our\\n      career after a long and weary journey we alighted at a small\\n      station some miles from chatham while a horse was being put into\\n      a trap at the local inn we snatched a hurried breakfast and so\\n      we were all ready for business when we at last arrived at yoxley\\n      old place a constable met us at the garden gate\\n\\n      well wilson any news\\n\\n      no sirnothing\\n\\n      no reports of any stranger seen\\n\\n      no sir down at the station they are certain that no stranger\\n      either came or went yesterday\\n\\n      have you had inquiries made at inns and lodgings\\n\\n      yes sir there is no one that we cannot account for\\n\\n      well its only a reasonable walk to chatham anyone might stay\\n      there or take a train without being observed this is the garden\\n      path of which i spoke mr holmes ill pledge my word there was\\n      no mark on it yesterday\\n\\n      on which side were the marks on the grass\\n\\n      this side sir this narrow margin of grass between the path and\\n      the flowerbed i cant see the traces now but they were clear\\n      to me then\\n\\n      yes yes someone has passed along said holmes stooping over\\n      the grass border our lady must have picked her steps carefully\\n      must she not since on the one side she would leave a track on\\n      the path and on the other an even clearer one on the soft bed\\n\\n      yes sir she must have been a cool hand\\n\\n      i saw an intent look pass over holmess face\\n\\n      you say that she must have come back this way\\n\\n      yes sir there is no other\\n\\n      on this strip of grass\\n\\n      certainly mr holmes\\n\\n      hum it was a very remarkable performancevery remarkable well\\n      i think we have exhausted the path let us go farther this\\n      garden door is usually kept open i suppose then this visitor\\n      had nothing to do but to walk in the idea of murder was not in\\n      her mind or she would have provided herself with some sort of\\n      weapon instead of having to pick this knife off the\\n      writingtable she advanced along this corridor leaving no\\n      traces upon the cocoanut matting then she found herself in this\\n      study how long was she there we have no means of judging\\n\\n      not more than a few minutes sir i forgot to tell you that mrs\\n      marker the housekeeper had been in there tidying not very long\\n      beforeabout a quarter of an hour she says\\n\\n      well that gives us a limit our lady enters this room and what\\n      does she do she goes over to the writingtable what for not\\n      for anything in the drawers if there had been anything worth her\\n      taking it would surely have been locked up no it was for\\n      something in that wooden bureau halloa what is that scratch\\n      upon the face of it just hold a match watson why did you not\\n      tell me of this hopkins\\n\\n      the mark which he was examining began upon the brasswork on the\\n      righthand side of the keyhole and extended for about four\\n      inches where it had scratched the varnish from the surface\\n\\n      i noticed it mr holmes but youll always find scratches round\\n      a keyhole\\n\\n      this is recent quite recent see how the brass shines where it\\n      is cut an old scratch would be the same colour as the surface\\n      look at it through my lens theres the varnish too like earth\\n      on each side of a furrow is mrs marker there\\n\\n      a sadfaced elderly woman came into the room\\n\\n      did you dust this bureau yesterday morning\\n\\n      yes sir\\n\\n      did you notice this scratch\\n\\n      no sir i did not\\n\\n      i am sure you did not for a duster would have swept away these\\n      shreds of varnish who has the key of this bureau\\n\\n      the professor keeps it on his watchchain\\n\\n      is it a simple key\\n\\n      no sir it is a chubbs key\\n\\n      very good mrs marker you can go now we are making a little\\n      progress our lady enters the room advances to the bureau and\\n      either opens it or tries to do so while she is thus engaged\\n      young willoughby smith enters the room in her hurry to withdraw\\n      the key she makes this scratch upon the door he seizes her and\\n      she snatching up the nearest object which happens to be this\\n      knife strikes at him in order to make him let go his hold the\\n      blow is a fatal one he falls and she escapes either with or\\n      without the object for which she has come is susan the maid\\n      there could anyone have got away through that door after the\\n      time that you heard the cry susan\\n\\n      no sir it is impossible before i got down the stair id have\\n      seen anyone in the passage besides the door never opened or i\\n      would have heard it\\n\\n      that settles this exit then no doubt the lady went out the way\\n      she came i understand that this other passage leads only to the\\n      professors room there is no exit that way\\n\\n      no sir\\n\\n      we shall go down it and make the acquaintance of the professor\\n      halloa hopkins this is very important very important indeed\\n      the professors corridor is also lined with cocoanut matting\\n\\n      well sir what of that\\n\\n      dont you see any bearing upon the case well well i dont\\n      insist upon it no doubt i am wrong and yet it seems to me to be\\n      suggestive come with me and introduce me\\n\\n      we passed down the passage which was of the same length as that\\n      which led to the garden at the end was a short flight of steps\\n      ending in a door our guide knocked and then ushered us into the\\n      professors bedroom\\n\\n      it was a very large chamber lined with innumerable volumes\\n      which had overflowed from the shelves and lay in piles in the\\n      corners or were stacked all round at the base of the cases the\\n      bed was in the centre of the room and in it propped up with\\n      pillows was the owner of the house i have seldom seen a more\\n      remarkablelooking person it was a gaunt aquiline face which\\n      was turned towards us with piercing dark eyes which lurked in\\n      deep hollows under overhung and tufted brows his hair and beard\\n      were white save that the latter was curiously stained with\\n      yellow around his mouth a cigarette glowed amid the tangle of\\n      white hair and the air of the room was fetid with stale tobacco\\n      smoke as he held out his hand to holmes i perceived that it was\\n      also stained with yellow nicotine\\n\\n      a smoker mr holmes said he speaking in wellchosen english\\n      with a curious little mincing accent pray take a cigarette and\\n      you sir i can recommend them for i have them especially\\n      prepared by ionides of alexandria he sends me a thousand at a\\n      time and i grieve to say that i have to arrange for a fresh\\n      supply every fortnight bad sir very bad but an old man has\\n      few pleasures tobacco and my workthat is all that is left to\\n      me\\n\\n      holmes had lit a cigarette and was shooting little darting\\n      glances all over the room\\n\\n      tobacco and my work but now only tobacco the old man\\n      exclaimed alas what a fatal interruption who could have\\n      foreseen such a terrible catastrophe so estimable a young man i\\n      assure you that after a few months training he was an\\n      admirable assistant what do you think of the matter mr\\n      holmes\\n\\n      i have not yet made up my mind\\n\\n      i shall indeed be indebted to you if you can throw a light where\\n      all is so dark to us to a poor bookworm and invalid like myself\\n      such a blow is paralysing i seem to have lost the faculty of\\n      thought but you are a man of actionyou are a man of affairs it\\n      is part of the everyday routine of your life you can preserve\\n      your balance in every emergency we are fortunate indeed in\\n      having you at our side\\n\\n      holmes was pacing up and down one side of the room whilst the old\\n      professor was talking i observed that he was smoking with\\n      extraordinary rapidity it was evident that he shared our hosts\\n      liking for the fresh alexandrian cigarettes\\n\\n      yes sir it is a crushing blow said the old man that is my\\n      magnum opusthe pile of papers on the side table yonder it is\\n      my analysis of the documents found in the coptic monasteries of\\n      syria and egypt a work which will cut deep at the very\\n      foundation of revealed religion with my enfeebled health i do\\n      not know whether i shall ever be able to complete it now that my\\n      assistant has been taken from me dear me mr holmes why you\\n      are even a quicker smoker than i am myself\\n\\n      holmes smiled\\n\\n      i am a connoisseur said he taking another cigarette from the\\n      boxhis fourthand lighting it from the stub of that which he had\\n      finished i will not trouble you with any lengthy\\n      crossexamination professor coram since i gather that you were\\n      in bed at the time of the crime and could know nothing about it\\n      i would only ask this what do you imagine that this poor fellow\\n      meant by his last words the professorit was she\\n\\n      the professor shook his head\\n\\n      susan is a country girl said he and you know the incredible\\n      stupidity of that class i fancy that the poor fellow murmured\\n      some incoherent delirious words and that she twisted them into\\n      this meaningless message\\n\\n      i see you have no explanation yourself of the tragedy\\n\\n      possibly an accident possiblyi only breathe it among\\n      ourselvesa suicide young men have their hidden troublessome\\n      affair of the heart perhaps which we have never known it is a\\n      more probable supposition than murder\\n\\n      but the eyeglasses\\n\\n      ah i am only a studenta man of dreams i cannot explain the\\n      practical things of life but still we are aware my friend\\n      that lovegages may take strange shapes by all means take\\n      another cigarette it is a pleasure to see anyone appreciate them\\n      so a fan a glove glasseswho knows what article may be carried\\n      as a token or treasured when a man puts an end to his life this\\n      gentleman speaks of footsteps in the grass but after all it is\\n      easy to be mistaken on such a point as to the knife it might\\n      well be thrown far from the unfortunate man as he fell it is\\n      possible that i speak as a child but to me it seems that\\n      willoughby smith has met his fate by his own hand\\n\\n      holmes seemed struck by the theory thus put forward and he\\n      continued to walk up and down for some time lost in thought and\\n      consuming cigarette after cigarette\\n\\n      tell me professor coram he said at last what is in that\\n      cupboard in the bureau\\n\\n      nothing that would help a thief family papers letters from my\\n      poor wife diplomas of universities which have done me honour\\n      here is the key you can look for yourself\\n\\n      holmes picked up the key and looked at it for an instant then\\n      he handed it back\\n\\n      no i hardly think that it would help me said he i should\\n      prefer to go quietly down to your garden and turn the whole\\n      matter over in my head there is something to be said for the\\n      theory of suicide which you have put forward we must apologize\\n      for having intruded upon you professor coram and i promise that\\n      we wont disturb you until after lunch at two oclock we will\\n      come again and report to you anything which may have happened in\\n      the interval\\n\\n      holmes was curiously distrait and we walked up and down the\\n      garden path for some time in silence\\n\\n      have you a clue i asked at last\\n\\n      it depends upon those cigarettes that i smoked said he it is\\n      possible that i am utterly mistaken the cigarettes will show\\n      me\\n\\n      my dear holmes i exclaimed how on earth\\n\\n      well well you may see for yourself if not theres no harm\\n      done of course we always have the optician clue to fall back\\n      upon but i take a short cut when i can get it ah here is the\\n      good mrs marker let us enjoy five minutes of instructive\\n      conversation with her\\n\\n      i may have remarked before that holmes had when he liked a\\n      peculiarly ingratiating way with women and that he very readily\\n      established terms of confidence with them in half the time which\\n      he had named he had captured the housekeepers goodwill and was\\n      chatting with her as if he had known her for years\\n\\n      yes mr holmes it is as you say sir he does smoke something\\n      terrible all day and sometimes all night sir ive seen that\\n      room of a morningwell sir youd have thought it was a london\\n      fog poor young mr smith he was a smoker also but not as bad\\n      as the professor his healthwell i dont know that its better\\n      nor worse for the smoking\\n\\n      ah said holmes but it kills the appetite\\n\\n      well i dont know about that sir\\n\\n      i suppose the professor eats hardly anything\\n\\n      well he is variable ill say that for him\\n\\n      ill wager he took no breakfast this morning and wont face his\\n      lunch after all the cigarettes i saw him consume\\n\\n      well youre out there sir as it happens for he ate a\\n      remarkable big breakfast this morning i dont know when ive\\n      known him make a better one and hes ordered a good dish of\\n      cutlets for his lunch im surprised myself for since i came\\n      into that room yesterday and saw young mr smith lying there on\\n      the floor i couldnt bear to look at food well it takes all\\n      sorts to make a world and the professor hasnt let it take his\\n      appetite away\\n\\n      we loitered the morning away in the garden stanley hopkins had\\n      gone down to the village to look into some rumours of a strange\\n      woman who had been seen by some children on the chatham road the\\n      previous morning as to my friend all his usual energy seemed to\\n      have deserted him i had never known him handle a case in such a\\n      halfhearted fashion even the news brought back by hopkins that\\n      he had found the children and that they had undoubtedly seen a\\n      woman exactly corresponding with holmess description and\\n      wearing either spectacles or eyeglasses failed to rouse any sign\\n      of keen interest he was more attentive when susan who waited\\n      upon us at lunch volunteered the information that she believed\\n      mr smith had been out for a walk yesterday morning and that he\\n      had only returned half an hour before the tragedy occurred i\\n      could not myself see the bearing of this incident but i clearly\\n      perceived that holmes was weaving it into the general scheme\\n      which he had formed in his brain suddenly he sprang from his\\n      chair and glanced at his watch two oclock gentlemen said\\n      he we must go up and have it out with our friend the\\n      professor\\n\\n      the old man had just finished his lunch and certainly his empty\\n      dish bore evidence to the good appetite with which his\\n      housekeeper had credited him he was indeed a weird figure as\\n      he turned his white mane and his glowing eyes towards us the\\n      eternal cigarette smouldered in his mouth he had been dressed\\n      and was seated in an armchair by the fire\\n\\n      well mr holmes have you solved this mystery yet he shoved\\n      the large tin of cigarettes which stood on a table beside him\\n      towards my companion holmes stretched out his hand at the same\\n      moment and between them they tipped the box over the edge for a\\n      minute or two we were all on our knees retrieving stray\\n      cigarettes from impossible places when we rose again i observed\\n      holmess eyes were shining and his cheeks tinged with colour\\n      only at a crisis have i seen those battlesignals flying\\n\\n      yes said he i have solved it\\n\\n      stanley hopkins and i stared in amazement something like a sneer\\n      quivered over the gaunt features of the old professor\\n\\n      indeed in the garden\\n\\n      no here\\n\\n      here when\\n\\n      this instant\\n\\n      you are surely joking mr sherlock holmes you compel me to\\n      tell you that this is too serious a matter to be treated in such\\n      a fashion\\n\\n      i have forged and tested every link of my chain professor\\n      coram and i am sure that it is sound what your motives are or\\n      what exact part you play in this strange business i am not yet\\n      able to say in a few minutes i shall probably hear it from your\\n      own lips meanwhile i will reconstruct what is past for your\\n      benefit so that you may know the information which i still\\n      require\\n\\n      a lady yesterday entered your study she came with the intention\\n      of possessing herself of certain documents which were in your\\n      bureau she had a key of her own i have had an opportunity of\\n      examining yours and i do not find that slight discolouration\\n      which the scratch made upon the varnish would have produced you\\n      were not an accessory therefore and she came so far as i can\\n      read the evidence without your knowledge to rob you\\n\\n      the professor blew a cloud from his lips this is most\\n      interesting and instructive said he have you no more to add\\n      surely having traced this lady so far you can also say what has\\n      become of her\\n\\n      i will endeavour to do so in the first place she was seized by\\n      your secretary and stabbed him in order to escape this\\n      catastrophe i am inclined to regard as an unhappy accident for i\\n      am convinced that the lady had no intention of inflicting so\\n      grievous an injury an assassin does not come unarmed horrified\\n      by what she had done she rushed wildly away from the scene of\\n      the tragedy unfortunately for her she had lost her glasses in\\n      the scuffle and as she was extremely shortsighted she was\\n      really helpless without them she ran down a corridor which she\\n      imagined to be that by which she had comeboth were lined with\\n      cocoanut mattingand it was only when it was too late that she\\n      understood that she had taken the wrong passage and that her\\n      retreat was cut off behind her what was she to do she could not\\n      go back she could not remain where she was she must go on she\\n      went on she mounted a stair pushed open a door and found\\n      herself in your room\\n\\n      the old man sat with his mouth open staring wildly at holmes\\n      amazement and fear were stamped upon his expressive features\\n      now with an effort he shrugged his shoulders and burst into\\n      insincere laughter\\n\\n      all very fine mr holmes said he but there is one little\\n      flaw in your splendid theory i was myself in my room and i\\n      never left it during the day\\n\\n      i am aware of that professor coram\\n\\n      and you mean to say that i could lie upon that bed and not be\\n      aware that a woman had entered my room\\n\\n      i never said so you were aware of it you spoke with her you\\n      recognized her you aided her to escape\\n\\n      again the professor burst into highkeyed laughter he had risen\\n      to his feet and his eyes glowed like embers\\n\\n      you are mad he cried you are talking insanely i helped her\\n      to escape where is she now\\n\\n      she is there said holmes and he pointed to a high bookcase in\\n      the corner of the room\\n\\n      i saw the old man throw up his arms a terrible convulsion passed\\n      over his grim face and he fell back in his chair at the same\\n      instant the bookcase at which holmes pointed swung round upon a\\n      hinge and a woman rushed out into the room you are right she\\n      cried in a strange foreign voice you are right i am here\\n\\n      she was brown with the dust and draped with the cobwebs which had\\n      come from the walls of her hidingplace her face too was\\n      streaked with grime and at the best she could never have been\\n      handsome for she had the exact physical characteristics which\\n      holmes had divined with in addition a long and obstinate chin\\n      what with her natural blindness and what with the change from\\n      dark to light she stood as one dazed blinking about her to see\\n      where and who we were and yet in spite of all these\\n      disadvantages there was a certain nobility in the womans\\n      bearinga gallantry in the defiant chin and in the upraised head\\n      which compelled something of respect and admiration\\n\\n      stanley hopkins had laid his hand upon her arm and claimed her as\\n      his prisoner but she waved him aside gently and yet with an\\n      overmastering dignity which compelled obedience the old man lay\\n      back in his chair with a twitching face and stared at her with\\n      brooding eyes\\n\\n      yes sir i am your prisoner she said from where i stood i\\n      could hear everything and i know that you have learned the\\n      truth i confess it all it was i who killed the young man but\\n      you are rightyou who say it was an accident i did not even know\\n      that it was a knife which i held in my hand for in my despair i\\n      snatched anything from the table and struck at him to make him\\n      let me go it is the truth that i tell\\n\\n      madam said holmes i am sure that it is the truth i fear\\n      that you are far from well\\n\\n      she had turned a dreadful colour the more ghastly under the dark\\n      duststreaks upon her face she seated herself on the side of the\\n      bed then she resumed\\n\\n      i have only a little time here she said but i would have you\\n      to know the whole truth i am this mans wife he is not an\\n      englishman he is a russian his name i will not tell\\n\\n      for the first time the old man stirred god bless you anna he\\n      cried god bless you\\n\\n      she cast a look of the deepest disdain in his direction why\\n      should you cling so hard to that wretched life of yours\\n      sergius said she it has done harm to many and good to\\n      nonenot even to yourself however it is not for me to cause the\\n      frail thread to be snapped before gods time i have enough\\n      already upon my soul since i crossed the threshold of this cursed\\n      house but i must speak or i shall be too late\\n\\n      i have said gentlemen that i am this mans wife he was fifty\\n      and i a foolish girl of twenty when we married it was in a city\\n      of russia a universityi will not name the place\\n\\n      god bless you anna murmured the old man again\\n\\n      we were reformersrevolutionistsnihilists you understand he\\n      and i and many more then there came a time of trouble a police\\n      officer was killed many were arrested evidence was wanted and\\n      in order to save his own life and to earn a great reward my\\n      husband betrayed his own wife and his companions yes we were\\n      all arrested upon his confession some of us found our way to the\\n      gallows and some to siberia i was among these last but my term\\n      was not for life my husband came to england with his illgotten\\n      gains and has lived in quiet ever since knowing well that if the\\n      brotherhood knew where he was not a week would pass before\\n      justice would be done\\n\\n      the old man reached out a trembling hand and helped himself to a\\n      cigarette i am in your hands anna said he you were always\\n      good to me\\n\\n      i have not yet told you the height of his villainy said she\\n      among our comrades of the order there was one who was the\\n      friend of my heart he was noble unselfish lovingall that my\\n      husband was not he hated violence we were all guiltyif that is\\n      guiltbut he was not he wrote forever dissuading us from such a\\n      course these letters would have saved him so would my diary in\\n      which from day to day i had entered both my feelings towards\\n      him and the view which each of us had taken my husband found and\\n      kept both diary and letters he hid them and he tried hard to\\n      swear away the young mans life in this he failed but alexis\\n      was sent a convict to siberia where now at this moment he\\n      works in a salt mine think of that you villain you\\n      villainnow now at this very moment alexis a man whose name\\n      you are not worthy to speak works and lives like a slave and\\n      yet i have your life in my hands and i let you go\\n\\n      you were always a noble woman anna said the old man puffing\\n      at his cigarette\\n\\n      she had risen but she fell back again with a little cry of pain\\n\\n      i must finish she said when my term was over i set myself to\\n      get the diary and letters which if sent to the russian\\n      government would procure my friends release i knew that my\\n      husband had come to england after months of searching i\\n      discovered where he was i knew that he still had the diary for\\n      when i was in siberia i had a letter from him once reproaching\\n      me and quoting some passages from its pages yet i was sure that\\n      with his revengeful nature he would never give it to me of his\\n      own freewill i must get it for myself with this object i\\n      engaged an agent from a private detective firm who entered my\\n      husbands house as a secretaryit was your second secretary\\n      sergius the one who left you so hurriedly he found that papers\\n      were kept in the cupboard and he got an impression of the key\\n      he would not go farther he furnished me with a plan of the\\n      house and he told me that in the forenoon the study was always\\n      empty as the secretary was employed up here so at last i took\\n      my courage in both hands and i came down to get the papers for\\n      myself i succeeded but at what a cost\\n\\n      i had just taken the paper and was locking the cupboard when\\n      the young man seized me i had seen him already that morning he\\n      had met me on the road and i had asked him to tell me where\\n      professor coram lived not knowing that he was in his employ\\n\\n      exactly exactly said holmes the secretary came back and\\n      told his employer of the woman he had met then in his last\\n      breath he tried to send a message that it was shethe she whom\\n      he had just discussed with him\\n\\n      you must let me speak said the woman in an imperative voice\\n      and her face contracted as if in pain when he had fallen i\\n      rushed from the room chose the wrong door and found myself in\\n      my husbands room he spoke of giving me up i showed him that if\\n      he did so his life was in my hands if he gave me to the law i\\n      could give him to the brotherhood it was not that i wished to\\n      live for my own sake but it was that i desired to accomplish my\\n      purpose he knew that i would do what i saidthat his own fate\\n      was involved in mine for that reason and for no other he\\n      shielded me he thrust me into that dark hidingplacea relic of\\n      old days known only to himself he took his meals in his own\\n      room and so was able to give me part of his food it was agreed\\n      that when the police left the house i should slip away by night\\n      and come back no more but in some way you have read our plans\\n      she tore from the bosom of her dress a small packet these are\\n      my last words said she here is the packet which will save\\n      alexis i confide it to your honour and to your love of justice\\n      take it you will deliver it at the russian embassy now i have\\n      done my duty and\\n\\n      stop her cried holmes he had bounded across the room and had\\n      wrenched a small phial from her hand\\n\\n      too late she said sinking back on the bed too late i took\\n      the poison before i left my hidingplace my head swims i am\\n      going i charge you sir to remember the packet\\n\\n      a simple case and yet in some ways an instructive one\\n      holmes remarked as we travelled back to town it hinged from\\n      the outset upon the pincenez but for the fortunate chance of\\n      the dying man having seized these i am not sure that we could\\n      ever have reached our solution it was clear to me from the\\n      strength of the glasses that the wearer must have been very\\n      blind and helpless when deprived of them when you asked me to\\n      believe that she walked along a narrow strip of grass without\\n      once making a false step i remarked as you may remember that\\n      it was a noteworthy performance in my mind i set it down as an\\n      impossible performance save in the unlikely case that she had a\\n      second pair of glasses i was forced therefore to consider\\n      seriously the hypothesis that she had remained within the house\\n      on perceiving the similarity of the two corridors it became\\n      clear that she might very easily have made such a mistake and\\n      in that case it was evident that she must have entered the\\n      professors room i was keenly on the alert therefore for\\n      whatever would bear out this supposition and i examined the room\\n      narrowly for anything in the shape of a hidingplace the carpet\\n      seemed continuous and firmly nailed so i dismissed the idea of a\\n      trapdoor there might well be a recess behind the books as you\\n      are aware such devices are common in old libraries i observed\\n      that books were piled on the floor at all other points but that\\n      one bookcase was left clear this then might be the door i\\n      could see no marks to guide me but the carpet was of a dun\\n      colour which lends itself very well to examination i therefore\\n      smoked a great number of those excellent cigarettes and i\\n      dropped the ash all over the space in front of the suspected\\n      bookcase it was a simple trick but exceedingly effective i\\n      then went downstairs and i ascertained in your presence\\n      watson without your perceiving the drift of my remarks that\\n      professor corams consumption of food had increasedas one would\\n      expect when he is supplying a second person we then ascended to\\n      the room again when by upsetting the cigarettebox i obtained\\n      a very excellent view of the floor and was able to see quite\\n      clearly from the traces upon the cigarette ash that the\\n      prisoner had in our absence come out from her retreat well\\n      hopkins here we are at charing cross and i congratulate you on\\n      having brought your case to a successful conclusion you are\\n      going to headquarters no doubt i think watson you and i will\\n      drive together to the russian embassy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe adventure of the missing threequarter\\n\\n\\n      we were fairly accustomed to receive weird telegrams at baker\\n      street but i have a particular recollection of one which reached\\n      us on a gloomy february morning some seven or eight years ago\\n      and gave mr sherlock holmes a puzzled quarter of an hour it was\\n      addressed to him and ran thus\\n\\n      please await me terrible misfortune right wing threequarter\\n      missing indispensable tomorrow overton\\n\\n      strand postmark and dispatched ten thirtysix said holmes\\n      reading it over and over mr overton was evidently considerably\\n      excited when he sent it and somewhat incoherent in consequence\\n      well well he will be here i daresay by the time i have looked\\n      through the times and then we shall know all about it even\\n      the most insignificant problem would be welcome in these stagnant\\n      days\\n\\n      things had indeed been very slow with us and i had learned to\\n      dread such periods of inaction for i knew by experience that my\\n      companions brain was so abnormally active that it was dangerous\\n      to leave it without material upon which to work for years i had\\n      gradually weaned him from that drug mania which had threatened\\n      once to check his remarkable career now i knew that under\\n      ordinary conditions he no longer craved for this artificial\\n      stimulus but i was well aware that the fiend was not dead but\\n      sleeping and i have known that the sleep was a light one and the\\n      waking near when in periods of idleness i have seen the drawn\\n      look upon holmess ascetic face and the brooding of his deepset\\n      and inscrutable eyes therefore i blessed this mr overton\\n      whoever he might be since he had come with his enigmatic message\\n      to break that dangerous calm which brought more peril to my\\n      friend than all the storms of his tempestuous life\\n\\n      as we had expected the telegram was soon followed by its sender\\n      and the card of mr cyril overton trinity college cambridge\\n      announced the arrival of an enormous young man sixteen stone of\\n      solid bone and muscle who spanned the doorway with his broad\\n      shoulders and looked from one of us to the other with a comely\\n      face which was haggard with anxiety\\n\\n      mr sherlock holmes\\n\\n      my companion bowed\\n\\n      ive been down to scotland yard mr holmes i saw inspector\\n      stanley hopkins he advised me to come to you he said the case\\n      so far as he could see was more in your line than in that of the\\n      regular police\\n\\n      pray sit down and tell me what is the matter\\n\\n      its awful mr holmessimply awful i wonder my hair isnt grey\\n      godfrey stauntonyouve heard of him of course hes simply the\\n      hinge that the whole team turns on id rather spare two from the\\n      pack and have godfrey for my threequarter line whether its\\n      passing or tackling or dribbling theres no one to touch him\\n      and then hes got the head and can hold us all together what\\n      am i to do thats what i ask you mr holmes theres moorhouse\\n      first reserve but he is trained as a half and he always edges\\n      right in on to the scrum instead of keeping out on the touchline\\n      hes a fine placekick its true but then he has no judgment\\n      and he cant sprint for nuts why morton or johnson the oxford\\n      fliers could romp round him stevenson is fast enough but he\\n      couldnt drop from the twentyfive line and a threequarter who\\n      cant either punt or drop isnt worth a place for pace alone no\\n      mr holmes we are done unless you can help me to find godfrey\\n      staunton\\n\\n      my friend had listened with amused surprise to this long speech\\n      which was poured forth with extraordinary vigour and earnestness\\n      every point being driven home by the slapping of a brawny hand\\n      upon the speakers knee when our visitor was silent holmes\\n      stretched out his hand and took down letter s of his\\n      commonplace book for once he dug in vain into that mine of\\n      varied information\\n\\n      there is arthur h staunton the rising young forger said he\\n      and there was henry staunton whom i helped to hang but godfrey\\n      staunton is a new name to me\\n\\n      it was our visitors turn to look surprised\\n\\n      why mr holmes i thought you knew things said he i\\n      suppose then if you have never heard of godfrey staunton you\\n      dont know cyril overton either\\n\\n      holmes shook his head good humouredly\\n\\n      great scott cried the athlete why i was first reserve for\\n      england against wales and ive skippered the varsity all this\\n      year but thats nothing i didnt think there was a soul in\\n      england who didnt know godfrey staunton the crack\\n      threequarter cambridge blackheath and five internationals\\n      good lord mr holmes where have you lived\\n\\n      holmes laughed at the young giants nave astonishment\\n\\n      you live in a different world to me mr overtona sweeter and\\n      healthier one my ramifications stretch out into many sections of\\n      society but never i am happy to say into amateur sport which\\n      is the best and soundest thing in england however your\\n      unexpected visit this morning shows me that even in that world of\\n      fresh air and fair play there may be work for me to do so now\\n      my good sir i beg you to sit down and to tell me slowly and\\n      quietly exactly what it is that has occurred and how you desire\\n      that i should help you\\n\\n      young overtons face assumed the bothered look of the man who is\\n      more accustomed to using his muscles than his wits but by\\n      degrees with many repetitions and obscurities which i may omit\\n      from his narrative he laid his strange story before us\\n\\n      its this way mr holmes as i have said i am the skipper of\\n      the rugger team of cambridge varsity and godfrey staunton is my\\n      best man tomorrow we play oxford yesterday we all came up and\\n      we settled at bentleys private hotel at ten oclock i went\\n      round and saw that all the fellows had gone to roost for i\\n      believe in strict training and plenty of sleep to keep a team\\n      fit i had a word or two with godfrey before he turned in he\\n      seemed to me to be pale and bothered i asked him what was the\\n      matter he said he was all rightjust a touch of headache i bade\\n      him goodnight and left him half an hour later the porter tells\\n      me that a roughlooking man with a beard called with a note for\\n      godfrey he had not gone to bed and the note was taken to his\\n      room godfrey read it and fell back in a chair as if he had been\\n      poleaxed the porter was so scared that he was going to fetch\\n      me but godfrey stopped him had a drink of water and pulled\\n      himself together then he went downstairs said a few words to\\n      the man who was waiting in the hall and the two of them went off\\n      together the last that the porter saw of them they were almost\\n      running down the street in the direction of the strand this\\n      morning godfreys room was empty his bed had never been slept\\n      in and his things were all just as i had seen them the night\\n      before he had gone off at a moments notice with this stranger\\n      and no word has come from him since i dont believe he will ever\\n      come back he was a sportsman was godfrey down to his marrow\\n      and he wouldnt have stopped his training and let in his skipper\\n      if it were not for some cause that was too strong for him no i\\n      feel as if he were gone for good and we should never see him\\n      again\\n\\n      sherlock holmes listened with the deepest attention to this\\n      singular narrative\\n\\n      what did you do he asked\\n\\n      i wired to cambridge to learn if anything had been heard of him\\n      there i have had an answer no one has seen him\\n\\n      could he have got back to cambridge\\n\\n      yes there is a late trainquarterpast eleven\\n\\n      but so far as you can ascertain he did not take it\\n\\n      no he has not been seen\\n\\n      what did you do next\\n\\n      i wired to lord mountjames\\n\\n      why to lord mountjames\\n\\n      godfrey is an orphan and lord mountjames is his nearest\\n      relativehis uncle i believe\\n\\n      indeed this throws new light upon the matter lord mountjames\\n      is one of the richest men in england\\n\\n      so ive heard godfrey say\\n\\n      and your friend was closely related\\n\\n      yes he was his heir and the old boy is nearly eightycram full\\n      of gout too they say he could chalk his billiardcue with his\\n      knuckles he never allowed godfrey a shilling in his life for he\\n      is an absolute miser but it will all come to him right enough\\n\\n      have you heard from lord mountjames\\n\\n      no\\n\\n      what motive could your friend have in going to lord\\n      mountjames\\n\\n      well something was worrying him the night before and if it was\\n      to do with money it is possible that he would make for his\\n      nearest relative who had so much of it though from all i have\\n      heard he would not have much chance of getting it godfrey was\\n      not fond of the old man he would not go if he could help it\\n\\n      well we can soon determine that if your friend was going to\\n      his relative lord mountjames you have then to explain the\\n      visit of this roughlooking fellow at so late an hour and the\\n      agitation that was caused by his coming\\n\\n      cyril overton pressed his hands to his head i can make nothing\\n      of it said he\\n\\n      well well i have a clear day and i shall be happy to look\\n      into the matter said holmes i should strongly recommend you\\n      to make your preparations for your match without reference to\\n      this young gentleman it must as you say have been an\\n      overpowering necessity which tore him away in such a fashion and\\n      the same necessity is likely to hold him away let us step round\\n      together to the hotel and see if the porter can throw any fresh\\n      light upon the matter\\n\\n      sherlock holmes was a pastmaster in the art of putting a humble\\n      witness at his ease and very soon in the privacy of godfrey\\n      stauntons abandoned room he had extracted all that the porter\\n      had to tell the visitor of the night before was not a gentleman\\n      neither was he a workingman he was simply what the porter\\n      described as a mediumlooking chap a man of fifty beard\\n      grizzled pale face quietly dressed he seemed himself to be\\n      agitated the porter had observed his hand trembling when he had\\n      held out the note godfrey staunton had crammed the note into his\\n      pocket staunton had not shaken hands with the man in the hall\\n      they had exchanged a few sentences of which the porter had only\\n      distinguished the one word time then they had hurried off in\\n      the manner described it was just halfpast ten by the hall\\n      clock\\n\\n      let me see said holmes seating himself on stauntons bed\\n      you are the day porter are you not\\n\\n      yes sir i go off duty at eleven\\n\\n      the night porter saw nothing i suppose\\n\\n      no sir one theatre party came in late no one else\\n\\n      were you on duty all day yesterday\\n\\n      yes sir\\n\\n      did you take any messages to mr staunton\\n\\n      yes sir one telegram\\n\\n      ah thats interesting what oclock was this\\n\\n      about six\\n\\n      where was mr staunton when he received it\\n\\n      here in his room\\n\\n      were you present when he opened it\\n\\n      yes sir i waited to see if there was an answer\\n\\n      well was there\\n\\n      yes sir he wrote an answer\\n\\n      did you take it\\n\\n      no he took it himself\\n\\n      but he wrote it in your presence\\n\\n      yes sir i was standing by the door and he with his back\\n      turned at that table when he had written it he said all\\n      right porter i will take this myself\\n\\n      what did he write it with\\n\\n      a pen sir\\n\\n      was the telegraphic form one of these on the table\\n\\n      yes sir it was the top one\\n\\n      holmes rose taking the forms he carried them over to the window\\n      and carefully examined that which was uppermost\\n\\n      it is a pity he did not write in pencil said he throwing them\\n      down again with a shrug of disappointment as you have no doubt\\n      frequently observed watson the impression usually goes\\n      througha fact which has dissolved many a happy marriage\\n      however i can find no trace here i rejoice however to\\n      perceive that he wrote with a broadpointed quill pen and i can\\n      hardly doubt that we will find some impression upon this\\n      blottingpad ah yes surely this is the very thing\\n\\n      he tore off a strip of the blottingpaper and turned towards us\\n      the following hieroglyphic\\n\\n      hieroglyphic\\n\\n      cyril overton was much excited hold it to the glass he cried\\n\\n      that is unnecessary said holmes the paper is thin and the\\n      reverse will give the message here it is he turned it over\\n      and we read\\n\\n      the reverse\\n\\n      so that is the tail end of the telegram which godfrey staunton\\n      dispatched within a few hours of his disappearance there are at\\n      least six words of the message which have escaped us but what\\n      remainsstand by us for gods sakeproves that this young man\\n      saw a formidable danger which approached him and from which\\n      someone else could protect him us mark you another person\\n      was involved who should it be but the palefaced bearded man\\n      who seemed himself in so nervous a state what then is the\\n      connection between godfrey staunton and the bearded man and what\\n      is the third source from which each of them sought for help\\n      against pressing danger our inquiry has already narrowed down to\\n      that\\n\\n      we have only to find to whom that telegram is addressed i\\n      suggested\\n\\n      exactly my dear watson your reflection though profound had\\n      already crossed my mind but i daresay it may have come to your\\n      notice that counterfoil of another mans message there may be\\n      some disinclination on the part of the officials to oblige you\\n      there is so much red tape in these matters however i have no\\n      doubt that with a little delicacy and finesse the end may be\\n      attained meanwhile i should like in your presence mr overton\\n      to go through these papers which have been left upon the table\\n\\n      there were a number of letters bills and notebooks which\\n      holmes turned over and examined with quick nervous fingers and\\n      darting penetrating eyes nothing here he said at last by\\n      the way i suppose your friend was a healthy young fellownothing\\n      amiss with him\\n\\n      sound as a bell\\n\\n      have you ever known him ill\\n\\n      not a day he has been laid up with a hack and once he slipped\\n      his kneecap but that was nothing\\n\\n      perhaps he was not so strong as you suppose i should think he\\n      may have had some secret trouble with your assent i will put\\n      one or two of these papers in my pocket in case they should bear\\n      upon our future inquiry\\n\\n      one momentone moment cried a querulous voice and we looked\\n      up to find a queer little old man jerking and twitching in the\\n      doorway he was dressed in rusty black with a very broadbrimmed\\n      tophat and a loose white necktiethe whole effect being that of\\n      a very rustic parson or of an undertakers mute yet in spite of\\n      his shabby and even absurd appearance his voice had a sharp\\n      crackle and his manner a quick intensity which commanded\\n      attention\\n\\n      who are you sir and by what right do you touch this\\n      gentlemans papers he asked\\n\\n      i am a private detective and i am endeavouring to explain his\\n      disappearance\\n\\n      oh you are are you and who instructed you eh\\n\\n      this gentleman mr stauntons friend was referred to me by\\n      scotland yard\\n\\n      who are you sir\\n\\n      i am cyril overton\\n\\n      then it is you who sent me a telegram my name is lord\\n      mountjames i came round as quickly as the bayswater bus would\\n      bring me so you have instructed a detective\\n\\n      yes sir\\n\\n      and are you prepared to meet the cost\\n\\n      i have no doubt sir that my friend godfrey when we find him\\n      will be prepared to do that\\n\\n      but if he is never found eh answer me that\\n\\n      in that case no doubt his family\\n\\n      nothing of the sort sir screamed the little man dont look\\n      to me for a pennynot a penny you understand that mr\\n      detective i am all the family that this young man has got and i\\n      tell you that i am not responsible if he has any expectations it\\n      is due to the fact that i have never wasted money and i do not\\n      propose to begin to do so now as to those papers with which you\\n      are making so free i may tell you that in case there should be\\n      anything of any value among them you will be held strictly to\\n      account for what you do with them\\n\\n      very good sir said sherlock holmes may i ask in the\\n      meanwhile whether you have yourself any theory to account for\\n      this young mans disappearance\\n\\n      no sir i have not he is big enough and old enough to look\\n      after himself and if he is so foolish as to lose himself i\\n      entirely refuse to accept the responsibility of hunting for him\\n\\n      i quite understand your position said holmes with a\\n      mischievous twinkle in his eyes perhaps you dont quite\\n      understand mine godfrey staunton appears to have been a poor\\n      man if he has been kidnapped it could not have been for\\n      anything which he himself possesses the fame of your wealth has\\n      gone abroad lord mountjames and it is entirely possible that a\\n      gang of thieves have secured your nephew in order to gain from\\n      him some information as to your house your habits and your\\n      treasure\\n\\n      the face of our unpleasant little visitor turned as white as his\\n      neckcloth\\n\\n      heavens sir what an idea i never thought of such villainy\\n      what inhuman rogues there are in the world but godfrey is a fine\\n      lada staunch lad nothing would induce him to give his old uncle\\n      away ill have the plate moved over to the bank this evening in\\n      the meantime spare no pains mr detective i beg you to leave no\\n      stone unturned to bring him safely back as to money well so\\n      far as a fiver or even a tenner goes you can always look to me\\n\\n      even in his chastened frame of mind the noble miser could give\\n      us no information which could help us for he knew little of the\\n      private life of his nephew our only clue lay in the truncated\\n      telegram and with a copy of this in his hand holmes set forth to\\n      find a second link for his chain we had shaken off lord\\n      mountjames and overton had gone to consult with the other\\n      members of his team over the misfortune which had befallen them\\n\\n      there was a telegraphoffice at a short distance from the hotel\\n      we halted outside it\\n\\n      its worth trying watson said holmes of course with a\\n      warrant we could demand to see the counterfoils but we have not\\n      reached that stage yet i dont suppose they remember faces in so\\n      busy a place let us venture it\\n\\n      i am sorry to trouble you said he in his blandest manner to\\n      the young woman behind the grating there is some small mistake\\n      about a telegram i sent yesterday i have had no answer and i\\n      very much fear that i must have omitted to put my name at the\\n      end could you tell me if this was so\\n\\n      the young woman turned over a sheaf of counterfoils\\n\\n      what oclock was it she asked\\n\\n      a little after six\\n\\n      whom was it to\\n\\n      holmes put his finger to his lips and glanced at me the last\\n      words in it were for gods sake he whispered confidentially\\n      i am very anxious at getting no answer\\n\\n      the young woman separated one of the forms\\n\\n      this is it there is no name said she smoothing it out upon\\n      the counter\\n\\n      then that of course accounts for my getting no answer said\\n      holmes dear me how very stupid of me to be sure\\n      goodmorning miss and many thanks for having relieved my mind\\n      he chuckled and rubbed his hands when we found ourselves in the\\n      street once more\\n\\n      well i asked\\n\\n      we progress my dear watson we progress i had seven different\\n      schemes for getting a glimpse of that telegram but i could\\n      hardly hope to succeed the very first time\\n\\n      and what have you gained\\n\\n      a startingpoint for our investigation he hailed a cab\\n      kings cross station said he\\n\\n      we have a journey then\\n\\n      yes i think we must run down to cambridge together all the\\n      indications seem to me to point in that direction\\n\\n      tell me i asked as we rattled up grays inn road have you\\n      any suspicion yet as to the cause of the disappearance i dont\\n      think that among all our cases i have known one where the motives\\n      are more obscure surely you dont really imagine that he may be\\n      kidnapped in order to give information against his wealthy\\n      uncle\\n\\n      i confess my dear watson that that does not appeal to me as a\\n      very probable explanation it struck me however as being the\\n      one which was most likely to interest that exceedingly unpleasant\\n      old person\\n\\n      it certainly did that but what are your alternatives\\n\\n      i could mention several you must admit that it is curious and\\n      suggestive that this incident should occur on the eve of this\\n      important match and should involve the only man whose presence\\n      seems essential to the success of the side it may of course be\\n      a coincidence but it is interesting amateur sport is free from\\n      betting but a good deal of outside betting goes on among the\\n      public and it is possible that it might be worth someones while\\n      to get at a player as the ruffians of the turf get at a\\n      racehorse there is one explanation a second very obvious one\\n      is that this young man really is the heir of a great property\\n      however modest his means may at present be and it is not\\n      impossible that a plot to hold him for ransom might be\\n      concocted\\n\\n      these theories take no account of the telegram\\n\\n      quite true watson the telegram still remains the only solid\\n      thing with which we have to deal and we must not permit our\\n      attention to wander away from it it is to gain light upon the\\n      purpose of this telegram that we are now upon our way to\\n      cambridge the path of our investigation is at present obscure\\n      but i shall be very much surprised if before evening we have not\\n      cleared it up or made a considerable advance along it\\n\\n      it was already dark when we reached the old university city\\n      holmes took a cab at the station and ordered the man to drive to\\n      the house of dr leslie armstrong a few minutes later we had\\n      stopped at a large mansion in the busiest thoroughfare we were\\n      shown in and after a long wait were at last admitted into the\\n      consultingroom where we found the doctor seated behind his\\n      table\\n\\n      it argues the degree in which i had lost touch with my profession\\n      that the name of leslie armstrong was unknown to me now i am\\n      aware that he is not only one of the heads of the medical school\\n      of the university but a thinker of european reputation in more\\n      than one branch of science yet even without knowing his\\n      brilliant record one could not fail to be impressed by a mere\\n      glance at the man the square massive face the brooding eyes\\n      under the thatched brows and the granite moulding of the\\n      inflexible jaw a man of deep character a man with an alert\\n      mind grim ascetic selfcontained formidableso i read dr\\n      leslie armstrong he held my friends card in his hand and he\\n      looked up with no very pleased expression upon his dour features\\n\\n      i have heard your name mr sherlock holmes and i am aware of\\n      your professionone of which i by no means approve\\n\\n      in that doctor you will find yourself in agreement with every\\n      criminal in the country said my friend quietly\\n\\n      so far as your efforts are directed towards the suppression of\\n      crime sir they must have the support of every reasonable member\\n      of the community though i cannot doubt that the official\\n      machinery is amply sufficient for the purpose where your calling\\n      is more open to criticism is when you pry into the secrets of\\n      private individuals when you rake up family matters which are\\n      better hidden and when you incidentally waste the time of men\\n      who are more busy than yourself at the present moment for\\n      example i should be writing a treatise instead of conversing\\n      with you\\n\\n      no doubt doctor and yet the conversation may prove more\\n      important than the treatise incidentally i may tell you that we\\n      are doing the reverse of what you very justly blame and that we\\n      are endeavouring to prevent anything like public exposure of\\n      private matters which must necessarily follow when once the case\\n      is fairly in the hands of the official police you may look upon\\n      me simply as an irregular pioneer who goes in front of the\\n      regular forces of the country i have come to ask you about mr\\n      godfrey staunton\\n\\n      what about him\\n\\n      you know him do you not\\n\\n      he is an intimate friend of mine\\n\\n      you are aware that he has disappeared\\n\\n      ah indeed there was no change of expression in the rugged\\n      features of the doctor\\n\\n      he left his hotel last nighthe has not been heard of\\n\\n      no doubt he will return\\n\\n      tomorrow is the varsity football match\\n\\n      i have no sympathy with these childish games the young mans\\n      fate interests me deeply since i know him and like him the\\n      football match does not come within my horizon at all\\n\\n      i claim your sympathy then in my investigation of mr\\n      stauntons fate do you know where he is\\n\\n      certainly not\\n\\n      you have not seen him since yesterday\\n\\n      no i have not\\n\\n      was mr staunton a healthy man\\n\\n      absolutely\\n\\n      did you ever know him ill\\n\\n      never\\n\\n      holmes popped a sheet of paper before the doctors eyes then\\n      perhaps you will explain this receipted bill for thirteen\\n      guineas paid by mr godfrey staunton last month to dr leslie\\n      armstrong of cambridge i picked it out from among the papers\\n      upon his desk\\n\\n      the doctor flushed with anger\\n\\n      i do not feel that there is any reason why i should render an\\n      explanation to you mr holmes\\n\\n      holmes replaced the bill in his notebook if you prefer a public\\n      explanation it must come sooner or later said he i have\\n      already told you that i can hush up that which others will be\\n      bound to publish and you would really be wiser to take me into\\n      your complete confidence\\n\\n      i know nothing about it\\n\\n      did you hear from mr staunton in london\\n\\n      certainly not\\n\\n      dear me dear methe postoffice again holmes sighed wearily\\n      a most urgent telegram was dispatched to you from london by\\n      godfrey staunton at sixfifteen yesterday eveninga telegram\\n      which is undoubtedly associated with his disappearanceand yet\\n      you have not had it it is most culpable i shall certainly go\\n      down to the office here and register a complaint\\n\\n      dr leslie armstrong sprang up from behind his desk and his dark\\n      face was crimson with fury\\n\\n      ill trouble you to walk out of my house sir said he you\\n      can tell your employer lord mountjames that i do not wish to\\n      have anything to do either with him or with his agents no\\n      sirnot another word he rang the bell furiously john show\\n      these gentlemen out a pompous butler ushered us severely to the\\n      door and we found ourselves in the street holmes burst out\\n      laughing\\n\\n      dr leslie armstrong is certainly a man of energy and\\n      character said he i have not seen a man who if he turns his\\n      talents that way was more calculated to fill the gap left by the\\n      illustrious moriarty and now my poor watson here we are\\n      stranded and friendless in this inhospitable town which we\\n      cannot leave without abandoning our case this little inn just\\n      opposite armstrongs house is singularly adapted to our needs if\\n      you would engage a front room and purchase the necessaries for\\n      the night i may have time to make a few inquiries\\n\\n      these few inquiries proved however to be a more lengthy\\n      proceeding than holmes had imagined for he did not return to the\\n      inn until nearly nine oclock he was pale and dejected stained\\n      with dust and exhausted with hunger and fatigue a cold supper\\n      was ready upon the table and when his needs were satisfied and\\n      his pipe alight he was ready to take that half comic and wholly\\n      philosophic view which was natural to him when his affairs were\\n      going awry the sound of carriage wheels caused him to rise and\\n      glance out of the window a brougham and pair of greys under the\\n      glare of a gaslamp stood before the doctors door\\n\\n      its been out three hours said holmes started at halfpast\\n      six and here it is back again that gives a radius of ten or\\n      twelve miles and he does it once or sometimes twice a day\\n\\n      no unusual thing for a doctor in practice\\n\\n      but armstrong is not really a doctor in practice he is a\\n      lecturer and a consultant but he does not care for general\\n      practice which distracts him from his literary work why then\\n      does he make these long journeys which must be exceedingly\\n      irksome to him and who is it that he visits\\n\\n      his coachman\\n\\n      my dear watson can you doubt that it was to him that i first\\n      applied i do not know whether it came from his own innate\\n      depravity or from the promptings of his master but he was rude\\n      enough to set a dog at me neither dog nor man liked the look of\\n      my stick however and the matter fell through relations were\\n      strained after that and further inquiries out of the question\\n      all that i have learned i got from a friendly native in the yard\\n      of our own inn it was he who told me of the doctors habits and\\n      of his daily journey at that instant to give point to his\\n      words the carriage came round to the door\\n\\n      could you not follow it\\n\\n      excellent watson you are scintillating this evening the idea\\n      did cross my mind there is as you may have observed a bicycle\\n      shop next to our inn into this i rushed engaged a bicycle and\\n      was able to get started before the carriage was quite out of\\n      sight i rapidly overtook it and then keeping at a discreet\\n      distance of a hundred yards or so i followed its lights until we\\n      were clear of the town we had got well out on the country road\\n      when a somewhat mortifying incident occurred the carriage\\n      stopped the doctor alighted walked swiftly back to where i had\\n      also halted and told me in an excellent sardonic fashion that he\\n      feared the road was narrow and that he hoped his carriage did\\n      not impede the passage of my bicycle nothing could have been\\n      more admirable than his way of putting it i at once rode past\\n      the carriage and keeping to the main road i went on for a few\\n      miles and then halted in a convenient place to see if the\\n      carriage passed there was no sign of it however and so it\\n      became evident that it had turned down one of several side roads\\n      which i had observed i rode back but again saw nothing of the\\n      carriage and now as you perceive it has returned after me of\\n      course i had at the outset no particular reason to connect these\\n      journeys with the disappearance of godfrey staunton and was only\\n      inclined to investigate them on the general grounds that\\n      everything which concerns dr armstrong is at present of interest\\n      to us but now that i find he keeps so keen a lookout upon\\n      anyone who may follow him on these excursions the affair appears\\n      more important and i shall not be satisfied until i have made\\n      the matter clear\\n\\n      we can follow him tomorrow\\n\\n      can we it is not so easy as you seem to think you are not\\n      familiar with cambridgeshire scenery are you it does not lend\\n      itself to concealment all this country that i passed over\\n      tonight is as flat and clean as the palm of your hand and the\\n      man we are following is no fool as he very clearly showed\\n      tonight i have wired to overton to let us know any fresh london\\n      developments at this address and in the meantime we can only\\n      concentrate our attention upon dr armstrong whose name the\\n      obliging young lady at the office allowed me to read upon the\\n      counterfoil of stauntons urgent message he knows where the\\n      young man isto that ill swear and if he knows then it must be\\n      our own fault if we cannot manage to know also at present it\\n      must be admitted that the odd trick is in his possession and as\\n      you are aware watson it is not my habit to leave the game in\\n      that condition\\n\\n      and yet the next day brought us no nearer to the solution of the\\n      mystery a note was handed in after breakfast which holmes\\n      passed across to me with a smile\\n\\n      sir it rani can assure you that you are wasting your time in\\n      dogging my movements i have as you discovered last night a\\n      window at the back of my brougham and if you desire a\\n      twentymile ride which will lead you to the spot from which you\\n      started you have only to follow me meanwhile i can inform you\\n      that no spying upon me can in any way help mr godfrey staunton\\n      and i am convinced that the best service you can do to that\\n      gentleman is to return at once to london and to report to your\\n      employer that you are unable to trace him your time in cambridge\\n      will certainly be wasted\\n\\n      yours faithfully\\n      leslie armstrong\\n\\n      an outspoken honest antagonist is the doctor said holmes\\n      well well he excites my curiosity and i must really know\\n      before i leave him\\n\\n      his carriage is at his door now said i there he is stepping\\n      into it i saw him glance up at our window as he did so suppose\\n      i try my luck upon the bicycle\\n\\n      no no my dear watson with all respect for your natural\\n      acumen i do not think that you are quite a match for the worthy\\n      doctor i think that possibly i can attain our end by some\\n      independent explorations of my own i am afraid that i must leave\\n      you to your own devices as the appearance of two inquiring\\n      strangers upon a sleepy countryside might excite more gossip than\\n      i care for no doubt you will find some sights to amuse you in\\n      this venerable city and i hope to bring back a more favourable\\n      report to you before evening\\n\\n      once more however my friend was destined to be disappointed he\\n      came back at night weary and unsuccessful\\n\\n      i have had a blank day watson having got the doctors general\\n      direction i spent the day in visiting all the villages upon that\\n      side of cambridge and comparing notes with publicans and other\\n      local news agencies i have covered some ground chesterton\\n      histon waterbeach and oakington have each been explored and\\n      have each proved disappointing the daily appearance of a\\n      brougham and pair could hardly have been overlooked in such\\n      sleepy hollows the doctor has scored once more is there a\\n      telegram for me\\n\\n      yes i opened it here it is\\n\\n      ask for pompey from jeremy dixon trinity college\\n\\n      i dont understand it\\n\\n      oh it is clear enough it is from our friend overton and is in\\n      answer to a question from me ill just send round a note to mr\\n      jeremy dixon and then i have no doubt that our luck will turn\\n      by the way is there any news of the match\\n\\n      yes the local evening paper has an excellent account in its\\n      last edition oxford won by a goal and two tries the last\\n      sentences of the description say\\n\\n      the defeat of the light blues may be entirely attributed to the\\n      unfortunate absence of the crack international godfrey staunton\\n      whose want was felt at every instant of the game the lack of\\n      combination in the threequarter line and their weakness both in\\n      attack and defence more than neutralized the efforts of a heavy\\n      and hardworking pack\\n\\n      then our friend overtons forebodings have been justified said\\n      holmes personally i am in agreement with dr armstrong and\\n      football does not come within my horizon early to bed tonight\\n      watson for i foresee that tomorrow may be an eventful day\\n\\n      i was horrified by my first glimpse of holmes next morning for\\n      he sat by the fire holding his tiny hypodermic syringe i\\n      associated that instrument with the single weakness of his\\n      nature and i feared the worst when i saw it glittering in his\\n      hand he laughed at my expression of dismay and laid it upon the\\n      table\\n\\n      no no my dear fellow there is no cause for alarm it is not\\n      upon this occasion the instrument of evil but it will rather\\n      prove to be the key which will unlock our mystery on this\\n      syringe i base all my hopes i have just returned from a small\\n      scouting expedition and everything is favourable eat a good\\n      breakfast watson for i propose to get upon dr armstrongs\\n      trail today and once on it i will not stop for rest or food\\n      until i run him to his burrow\\n\\n      in that case said i we had best carry our breakfast with us\\n      for he is making an early start his carriage is at the door\\n\\n      never mind let him go he will be clever if he can drive where\\n      i cannot follow him when you have finished come downstairs with\\n      me and i will introduce you to a detective who is a very eminent\\n      specialist in the work that lies before us\\n\\n      when we descended i followed holmes into the stable yard where\\n      he opened the door of a loosebox and led out a squat lopeared\\n      whiteandtan dog something between a beagle and a foxhound\\n\\n      let me introduce you to pompey said he pompey is the pride\\n      of the local draghoundsno very great flier as his build will\\n      show but a staunch hound on a scent well pompey you may not\\n      be fast but i expect you will be too fast for a couple of\\n      middleaged london gentlemen so i will take the liberty of\\n      fastening this leather leash to your collar now boy come\\n      along and show what you can do he led him across to the\\n      doctors door the dog sniffed round for an instant and then\\n      with a shrill whine of excitement started off down the street\\n      tugging at his leash in his efforts to go faster in half an\\n      hour we were clear of the town and hastening down a country\\n      road\\n\\n      what have you done holmes i asked\\n\\n      a threadbare and venerable device but useful upon occasion i\\n      walked into the doctors yard this morning and shot my syringe\\n      full of aniseed over the hind wheel a draghound will follow\\n      aniseed from here to john ogroats and our friend armstrong\\n      would have to drive through the cam before he would shake pompey\\n      off his trail oh the cunning rascal this is how he gave me the\\n      slip the other night\\n\\n      the dog had suddenly turned out of the main road into a\\n      grassgrown lane half a mile farther this opened into another\\n      broad road and the trail turned hard to the right in the\\n      direction of the town which we had just quitted the road took a\\n      sweep to the south of the town and continued in the opposite\\n      direction to that in which we started\\n\\n      this dtour has been entirely for our benefit then said\\n      holmes no wonder that my inquiries among those villagers led to\\n      nothing the doctor has certainly played the game for all it is\\n      worth and one would like to know the reason for such elaborate\\n      deception this should be the village of trumpington to the right\\n      of us and by jove here is the brougham coming round the\\n      corner quick watsonquick or we are done\\n\\n      he sprang through a gate into a field dragging the reluctant\\n      pompey after him we had hardly got under the shelter of the\\n      hedge when the carriage rattled past i caught a glimpse of dr\\n      armstrong within his shoulders bowed his head sunk on his\\n      hands the very image of distress i could tell by my companions\\n      graver face that he also had seen\\n\\n      i fear there is some dark ending to our quest said he it\\n      cannot be long before we know it come pompey ah it is the\\n      cottage in the field\\n\\n      there could be no doubt that we had reached the end of our\\n      journey pompey ran about and whined eagerly outside the gate\\n      where the marks of the broughams wheels were still to be seen a\\n      footpath led across to the lonely cottage holmes tied the dog to\\n      the hedge and we hastened onward my friend knocked at the\\n      little rustic door and knocked again without response and yet\\n      the cottage was not deserted for a low sound came to our earsa\\n      kind of drone of misery and despair which was indescribably\\n      melancholy holmes paused irresolute and then he glanced back at\\n      the road which he had just traversed a brougham was coming down\\n      it and there could be no mistaking those grey horses\\n\\n      by jove the doctor is coming back cried holmes that settles\\n      it we are bound to see what it means before he comes\\n\\n      he opened the door and we stepped into the hall the droning\\n      sound swelled louder upon our ears until it became one long deep\\n      wail of distress it came from upstairs holmes darted up and i\\n      followed him he pushed open a halfclosed door and we both\\n      stood appalled at the sight before us\\n\\n      a woman young and beautiful was lying dead upon the bed her\\n      calm pale face with dim wideopened blue eyes looked upward\\n      from amid a great tangle of golden hair at the foot of the bed\\n      half sitting half kneeling his face buried in the clothes was\\n      a young man whose frame was racked by his sobs so absorbed was\\n      he by his bitter grief that he never looked up until holmess\\n      hand was on his shoulder\\n\\n      are you mr godfrey staunton\\n\\n      yes yes i ambut you are too late she is dead\\n\\n      the man was so dazed that he could not be made to understand that\\n      we were anything but doctors who had been sent to his assistance\\n      holmes was endeavouring to utter a few words of consolation and\\n      to explain the alarm which had been caused to his friends by his\\n      sudden disappearance when there was a step upon the stairs and\\n      there was the heavy stern questioning face of dr armstrong at\\n      the door\\n\\n      so gentlemen said he you have attained your end and have\\n      certainly chosen a particularly delicate moment for your\\n      intrusion i would not brawl in the presence of death but i can\\n      assure you that if i were a younger man your monstrous conduct\\n      would not pass with impunity\\n\\n      excuse me dr armstrong i think we are a little at\\n      crosspurposes said my friend with dignity if you could step\\n      downstairs with us we may each be able to give some light to the\\n      other upon this miserable affair\\n\\n      a minute later the grim doctor and ourselves were in the\\n      sittingroom below\\n\\n      well sir said he\\n\\n      i wish you to understand in the first place that i am not\\n      employed by lord mountjames and that my sympathies in this\\n      matter are entirely against that nobleman when a man is lost it\\n      is my duty to ascertain his fate but having done so the matter\\n      ends so far as i am concerned and so long as there is nothing\\n      criminal i am much more anxious to hush up private scandals than\\n      to give them publicity if as i imagine there is no breach of\\n      the law in this matter you can absolutely depend upon my\\n      discretion and my cooperation in keeping the facts out of the\\n      papers\\n\\n      dr armstrong took a quick step forward and wrung holmes by the\\n      hand\\n\\n      you are a good fellow said he i had misjudged you i thank\\n      heaven that my compunction at leaving poor staunton all alone in\\n      this plight caused me to turn my carriage back and so to make\\n      your acquaintance knowing as much as you do the situation is\\n      very easily explained a year ago godfrey staunton lodged in\\n      london for a time and became passionately attached to his\\n      landladys daughter whom he married she was as good as she was\\n      beautiful and as intelligent as she was good no man need be\\n      ashamed of such a wife but godfrey was the heir to this crabbed\\n      old nobleman and it was quite certain that the news of his\\n      marriage would have been the end of his inheritance i knew the\\n      lad well and i loved him for his many excellent qualities i did\\n      all i could to help him to keep things straight we did our very\\n      best to keep the thing from everyone for when once such a\\n      whisper gets about it is not long before everyone has heard it\\n      thanks to this lonely cottage and his own discretion godfrey has\\n      up to now succeeded their secret was known to no one save to me\\n      and to one excellent servant who has at present gone for\\n      assistance to trumpington but at last there came a terrible blow\\n      in the shape of dangerous illness to his wife it was consumption\\n      of the most virulent kind the poor boy was half crazed with\\n      grief and yet he had to go to london to play this match for he\\n      could not get out of it without explanations which would expose\\n      his secret i tried to cheer him up by wire and he sent me one\\n      in reply imploring me to do all i could this was the telegram\\n      which you appear in some inexplicable way to have seen i did not\\n      tell him how urgent the danger was for i knew that he could do\\n      no good here but i sent the truth to the girls father and he\\n      very injudiciously communicated it to godfrey the result was\\n      that he came straight away in a state bordering on frenzy and\\n      has remained in the same state kneeling at the end of her bed\\n      until this morning death put an end to her sufferings that is\\n      all mr holmes and i am sure that i can rely upon your\\n      discretion and that of your friend\\n\\n      holmes grasped the doctors hand\\n\\n      come watson said he and we passed from that house of grief\\n      into the pale sunlight of the winter day\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe adventure of the abbey grange\\n\\n\\n      it was on a bitterly cold and frosty morning towards the end of\\n      the winter of  that i was awakened by a tugging at my\\n      shoulder it was holmes the candle in his hand shone upon his\\n      eager stooping face and told me at a glance that something was\\n      amiss\\n\\n      come watson come he cried the game is afoot not a word\\n      into your clothes and come\\n\\n      ten minutes later we were both in a cab and rattling through the\\n      silent streets on our way to charing cross station the first\\n      faint winters dawn was beginning to appear and we could dimly\\n      see the occasional figure of an early workman as he passed us\\n      blurred and indistinct in the opalescent london reek holmes\\n      nestled in silence into his heavy coat and i was glad to do the\\n      same for the air was most bitter and neither of us had broken\\n      our fast\\n\\n      it was not until we had consumed some hot tea at the station and\\n      taken our places in the kentish train that we were sufficiently\\n      thawed he to speak and i to listen holmes drew a note from his\\n      pocket and read aloud\\n\\n      abbey grange marsham kent  am\\n      my dear mr holmes\\n\\n      i should be very glad of your immediate assistance in what\\n      promises to be a most remarkable case it is something quite in\\n      your line except for releasing the lady i will see that\\n      everything is kept exactly as i have found it but i beg you not\\n      to lose an instant as it is difficult to leave sir eustace\\n      there\\n\\n      yours faithfully\\n      stanley hopkins\\n\\n      hopkins has called me in seven times and on each occasion his\\n      summons has been entirely justified said holmes i fancy that\\n      every one of his cases has found its way into your collection\\n      and i must admit watson that you have some power of selection\\n      which atones for much which i deplore in your narratives your\\n      fatal habit of looking at everything from the point of view of a\\n      story instead of as a scientific exercise has ruined what might\\n      have been an instructive and even classical series of\\n      demonstrations you slur over work of the utmost finesse and\\n      delicacy in order to dwell upon sensational details which may\\n      excite but cannot possibly instruct the reader\\n\\n      why do you not write them yourself i said with some\\n      bitterness\\n\\n      i will my dear watson i will at present i am as you know\\n      fairly busy but i propose to devote my declining years to the\\n      composition of a textbook which shall focus the whole art of\\n      detection into one volume our present research appears to be a\\n      case of murder\\n\\n      you think this sir eustace is dead then\\n\\n      i should say so hopkinss writing shows considerable agitation\\n      and he is not an emotional man yes i gather there has been\\n      violence and that the body is left for our inspection a mere\\n      suicide would not have caused him to send for me as to the\\n      release of the lady it would appear that she has been locked in\\n      her room during the tragedy we are moving in high life watson\\n      crackling paper eb monogram coatofarms picturesque\\n      address i think that friend hopkins will live up to his\\n      reputation and that we shall have an interesting morning the\\n      crime was committed before twelve last night\\n\\n      how can you possibly tell\\n\\n      by an inspection of the trains and by reckoning the time the\\n      local police had to be called in they had to communicate with\\n      scotland yard hopkins had to go out and he in turn had to send\\n      for me all that makes a fair nights work well here we are at\\n      chiselhurst station and we shall soon set our doubts at rest\\n\\n      a drive of a couple of miles through narrow country lanes brought\\n      us to a park gate which was opened for us by an old\\n      lodgekeeper whose haggard face bore the reflection of some\\n      great disaster the avenue ran through a noble park between\\n      lines of ancient elms and ended in a low widespread house\\n      pillared in front after the fashion of palladio the central part\\n      was evidently of a great age and shrouded in ivy but the large\\n      windows showed that modern changes had been carried out and one\\n      wing of the house appeared to be entirely new the youthful\\n      figure and alert eager face of inspector stanley hopkins\\n      confronted us in the open doorway\\n\\n      im very glad you have come mr holmes and you too dr\\n      watson but indeed if i had my time over again i should not\\n      have troubled you for since the lady has come to herself she\\n      has given so clear an account of the affair that there is not\\n      much left for us to do you remember that lewisham gang of\\n      burglars\\n\\n      what the three randalls\\n\\n      exactly the father and two sons its their work i have not a\\n      doubt of it they did a job at sydenham a fortnight ago and were\\n      seen and described rather cool to do another so soon and so\\n      near but it is they beyond all doubt its a hanging matter\\n      this time\\n\\n      sir eustace is dead then\\n\\n      yes his head was knocked in with his own poker\\n\\n      sir eustace brackenstall the driver tells me\\n\\n      exactlyone of the richest men in kentlady brackenstall is in\\n      the morningroom poor lady she has had a most dreadful\\n      experience she seemed half dead when i saw her first i think\\n      you had best see her and hear her account of the facts then we\\n      will examine the diningroom together\\n\\n      lady brackenstall was no ordinary person seldom have i seen so\\n      graceful a figure so womanly a presence and so beautiful a\\n      face she was a blonde goldenhaired blueeyed and would no\\n      doubt have had the perfect complexion which goes with such\\n      colouring had not her recent experience left her drawn and\\n      haggard her sufferings were physical as well as mental for over\\n      one eye rose a hideous plumcoloured swelling which her maid a\\n      tall austere woman was bathing assiduously with vinegar and\\n      water the lady lay back exhausted upon a couch but her quick\\n      observant gaze as we entered the room and the alert expression\\n      of her beautiful features showed that neither her wits nor her\\n      courage had been shaken by her terrible experience she was\\n      enveloped in a loose dressinggown of blue and silver but a\\n      black sequincovered dinnerdress lay upon the couch beside her\\n\\n      i have told you all that happened mr hopkins she said\\n      wearily could you not repeat it for me well if you think it\\n      necessary i will tell these gentlemen what occurred have they\\n      been in the diningroom yet\\n\\n      i thought they had better hear your ladyships story first\\n\\n      i shall be glad when you can arrange matters it is horrible to\\n      me to think of him still lying there she shuddered and buried\\n      her face in her hands as she did so the loose gown fell back\\n      from her forearms holmes uttered an exclamation\\n\\n      you have other injuries madam what is this two vivid red\\n      spots stood out on one of the white round limbs she hastily\\n      covered it\\n\\n      it is nothing it has no connection with this hideous business\\n      tonight if you and your friend will sit down i will tell you\\n      all i can\\n\\n      i am the wife of sir eustace brackenstall i have been married\\n      about a year i suppose that it is no use my attempting to\\n      conceal that our marriage has not been a happy one i fear that\\n      all our neighbours would tell you that even if i were to attempt\\n      to deny it perhaps the fault may be partly mine i was brought\\n      up in the freer less conventional atmosphere of south australia\\n      and this english life with its proprieties and its primness is\\n      not congenial to me but the main reason lies in the one fact\\n      which is notorious to everyone and that is that sir eustace was\\n      a confirmed drunkard to be with such a man for an hour is\\n      unpleasant can you imagine what it means for a sensitive and\\n      highspirited woman to be tied to him for day and night it is a\\n      sacrilege a crime a villainy to hold that such a marriage is\\n      binding i say that these monstrous laws of yours will bring a\\n      curse upon the landgod will not let such wickedness endure for\\n      an instant she sat up her cheeks flushed and her eyes blazing\\n      from under the terrible mark upon her brow then the strong\\n      soothing hand of the austere maid drew her head down on to the\\n      cushion and the wild anger died away into passionate sobbing at\\n      last she continued\\n\\n      i will tell you about last night you are aware perhaps that\\n      in this house all the servants sleep in the modern wing this\\n      central block is made up of the dwellingrooms with the kitchen\\n      behind and our bedroom above my maid theresa sleeps above my\\n      room there is no one else and no sound could alarm those who\\n      are in the farther wing this must have been wellknown to the\\n      robbers or they would not have acted as they did\\n\\n      sir eustace retired about halfpast ten the servants had\\n      already gone to their quarters only my maid was up and she had\\n      remained in her room at the top of the house until i needed her\\n      services i sat until after eleven in this room absorbed in a\\n      book then i walked round to see that all was right before i went\\n      upstairs it was my custom to do this myself for as i have\\n      explained sir eustace was not always to be trusted i went into\\n      the kitchen the butlers pantry the gunroom the\\n      billiardroom the drawingroom and finally the diningroom as\\n      i approached the window which is covered with thick curtains i\\n      suddenly felt the wind blow upon my face and realized that it was\\n      open i flung the curtain aside and found myself face to face\\n      with a broadshouldered elderly man who had just stepped into\\n      the room the window is a long french one which really forms a\\n      door leading to the lawn i held my bedroom candle lit in my\\n      hand and by its light behind the first man i saw two others\\n      who were in the act of entering i stepped back but the fellow\\n      was on me in an instant he caught me first by the wrist and then\\n      by the throat i opened my mouth to scream but he struck me a\\n      savage blow with his fist over the eye and felled me to the\\n      ground i must have been unconscious for a few minutes for when\\n      i came to myself i found that they had torn down the bellrope\\n      and had secured me tightly to the oaken chair which stands at the\\n      head of the diningtable i was so firmly bound that i could not\\n      move and a handkerchief round my mouth prevented me from\\n      uttering a sound it was at this instant that my unfortunate\\n      husband entered the room he had evidently heard some suspicious\\n      sounds and he came prepared for such a scene as he found he was\\n      dressed in nightshirt and trousers with his favourite blackthorn\\n      cudgel in his hand he rushed at the burglars but anotherit was\\n      an elderly manstooped picked the poker out of the grate and\\n      struck him a horrible blow as he passed he fell with a groan and\\n      never moved again i fainted once more but again it could only\\n      have been for a very few minutes during which i was insensible\\n      when i opened my eyes i found that they had collected the silver\\n      from the sideboard and they had drawn a bottle of wine which\\n      stood there each of them had a glass in his hand i have already\\n      told you have i not that one was elderly with a beard and the\\n      others young hairless lads they might have been a father with\\n      his two sons they talked together in whispers then they came\\n      over and made sure that i was securely bound finally they\\n      withdrew closing the window after them it was quite a quarter\\n      of an hour before i got my mouth free when i did so my screams\\n      brought the maid to my assistance the other servants were soon\\n      alarmed and we sent for the local police who instantly\\n      communicated with london that is really all that i can tell you\\n      gentlemen and i trust that it will not be necessary for me to go\\n      over so painful a story again\\n\\n      any questions mr holmes asked hopkins\\n\\n      i will not impose any further tax upon lady brackenstalls\\n      patience and time said holmes before i go into the\\n      diningroom i should like to hear your experience he looked at\\n      the maid\\n\\n      i saw the men before ever they came into the house said she\\n      as i sat by my bedroom window i saw three men in the moonlight\\n      down by the lodge gate yonder but i thought nothing of it at the\\n      time it was more than an hour after that i heard my mistress\\n      scream and down i ran to find her poor lamb just as she says\\n      and him on the floor with his blood and brains over the room it\\n      was enough to drive a woman out of her wits tied there and her\\n      very dress spotted with him but she never wanted courage did\\n      miss mary fraser of adelaide and lady brackenstall of abbey\\n      grange hasnt learned new ways youve questioned her long\\n      enough you gentlemen and now she is coming to her own room\\n      just with her old theresa to get the rest that she badly needs\\n\\n      with a motherly tenderness the gaunt woman put her arm round her\\n      mistress and led her from the room\\n\\n      she has been with her all her life said hopkins nursed her\\n      as a baby and came with her to england when they first left\\n      australia eighteen months ago theresa wright is her name and\\n      the kind of maid you dont pick up nowadays this way mr\\n      holmes if you please\\n\\n      the keen interest had passed out of holmess expressive face and\\n      i knew that with the mystery all the charm of the case had\\n      departed there still remained an arrest to be effected but what\\n      were these commonplace rogues that he should soil his hands with\\n      them an abstruse and learned specialist who finds that he has\\n      been called in for a case of measles would experience something\\n      of the annoyance which i read in my friends eyes yet the scene\\n      in the diningroom of the abbey grange was sufficiently strange\\n      to arrest his attention and to recall his waning interest\\n\\n      it was a very large and high chamber with carved oak ceiling\\n      oaken panelling and a fine array of deers heads and ancient\\n      weapons around the walls at the further end from the door was\\n      the high french window of which we had heard three smaller\\n      windows on the righthand side filled the apartment with cold\\n      winter sunshine on the left was a large deep fireplace with a\\n      massive overhanging oak mantelpiece beside the fireplace was a\\n      heavy oaken chair with arms and crossbars at the bottom in and\\n      out through the open woodwork was woven a crimson cord which was\\n      secured at each side to the crosspiece below in releasing the\\n      lady the cord had been slipped off her but the knots with which\\n      it had been secured still remained these details only struck our\\n      attention afterwards for our thoughts were entirely absorbed by\\n      the terrible object which lay upon the tigerskin hearthrug in\\n      front of the fire\\n\\n      it was the body of a tall wellmade man about forty years of\\n      age he lay upon his back his face upturned with his white\\n      teeth grinning through his short black beard his two clenched\\n      hands were raised above his head and a heavy blackthorn stick\\n      lay across them his dark handsome aquiline features were\\n      convulsed into a spasm of vindictive hatred which had set his\\n      dead face in a terribly fiendish expression he had evidently\\n      been in his bed when the alarm had broken out for he wore a\\n      foppish embroidered nightshirt and his bare feet projected from\\n      his trousers his head was horribly injured and the whole room\\n      bore witness to the savage ferocity of the blow which had struck\\n      him down beside him lay the heavy poker bent into a curve by\\n      the concussion holmes examined both it and the indescribable\\n      wreck which it had wrought\\n\\n      he must be a powerful man this elder randall he remarked\\n\\n      yes said hopkins i have some record of the fellow and he is\\n      a rough customer\\n\\n      you should have no difficulty in getting him\\n\\n      not the slightest we have been on the lookout for him and\\n      there was some idea that he had got away to america now that we\\n      know that the gang are here i dont see how they can escape we\\n      have the news at every seaport already and a reward will be\\n      offered before evening what beats me is how they could have done\\n      so mad a thing knowing that the lady could describe them and\\n      that we could not fail to recognize the description\\n\\n      exactly one would have expected that they would silence lady\\n      brackenstall as well\\n\\n      they may not have realized i suggested that she had\\n      recovered from her faint\\n\\n      that is likely enough if she seemed to be senseless they would\\n      not take her life what about this poor fellow hopkins i seem\\n      to have heard some queer stories about him\\n\\n      he was a goodhearted man when he was sober but a perfect fiend\\n      when he was drunk or rather when he was half drunk for he\\n      seldom really went the whole way the devil seemed to be in him\\n      at such times and he was capable of anything from what i hear\\n      in spite of all his wealth and his title he very nearly came our\\n      way once or twice there was a scandal about his drenching a dog\\n      with petroleum and setting it on fireher ladyships dog to make\\n      the matter worseand that was only hushed up with difficulty\\n      then he threw a decanter at that maid theresa wrightthere was\\n      trouble about that on the whole and between ourselves it will\\n      be a brighter house without him what are you looking at now\\n\\n      holmes was down on his knees examining with great attention the\\n      knots upon the red cord with which the lady had been secured\\n      then he carefully scrutinized the broken and frayed end where it\\n      had snapped off when the burglar had dragged it down\\n\\n      when this was pulled down the bell in the kitchen must have\\n      rung loudly he remarked\\n\\n      no one could hear it the kitchen stands right at the back of\\n      the house\\n\\n      how did the burglar know no one would hear it how dared he pull\\n      at a bellrope in that reckless fashion\\n\\n      exactly mr holmes exactly you put the very question which i\\n      have asked myself again and again there can be no doubt that\\n      this fellow must have known the house and its habits he must\\n      have perfectly understood that the servants would all be in bed\\n      at that comparatively early hour and that no one could possibly\\n      hear a bell ring in the kitchen therefore he must have been in\\n      close league with one of the servants surely that is evident\\n      but there are eight servants and all of good character\\n\\n      other things being equal said holmes one would suspect the\\n      one at whose head the master threw a decanter and yet that would\\n      involve treachery towards the mistress to whom this woman seems\\n      devoted well well the point is a minor one and when you have\\n      randall you will probably find no difficulty in securing his\\n      accomplice the ladys story certainly seems to be corroborated\\n      if it needed corroboration by every detail which we see before\\n      us he walked to the french window and threw it open there are\\n      no signs here but the ground is iron hard and one would not\\n      expect them i see that these candles in the mantelpiece have\\n      been lighted\\n\\n      yes it was by their light and that of the ladys bedroom\\n      candle that the burglars saw their way about\\n\\n      and what did they take\\n\\n      well they did not take muchonly half a dozen articles of plate\\n      off the sideboard lady brackenstall thinks that they were\\n      themselves so disturbed by the death of sir eustace that they did\\n      not ransack the house as they would otherwise have done\\n\\n      no doubt that is true and yet they drank some wine i\\n      understand\\n\\n      to steady their nerves\\n\\n      exactly these three glasses upon the sideboard have been\\n      untouched i suppose\\n\\n      yes and the bottle stands as they left it\\n\\n      let us look at it halloa halloa what is this\\n\\n      the three glasses were grouped together all of them tinged with\\n      wine and one of them containing some dregs of beeswing the\\n      bottle stood near them twothirds full and beside it lay a\\n      long deeply stained cork its appearance and the dust upon the\\n      bottle showed that it was no common vintage which the murderers\\n      had enjoyed\\n\\n      a change had come over holmess manner he had lost his listless\\n      expression and again i saw an alert light of interest in his\\n      keen deepset eyes he raised the cork and examined it minutely\\n\\n      how did they draw it he asked\\n\\n      hopkins pointed to a halfopened drawer in it lay some table\\n      linen and a large corkscrew\\n\\n      did lady brackenstall say that screw was used\\n\\n      no you remember that she was senseless at the moment when the\\n      bottle was opened\\n\\n      quite so as a matter of fact that screw was not used this\\n      bottle was opened by a pocket screw probably contained in a\\n      knife and not more than an inch and a half long if you will\\n      examine the top of the cork you will observe that the screw was\\n      driven in three times before the cork was extracted it has never\\n      been transfixed this long screw would have transfixed it and\\n      drawn it up with a single pull when you catch this fellow you\\n      will find that he has one of these multiplex knives in his\\n      possession\\n\\n      excellent said hopkins\\n\\n      but these glasses do puzzle me i confess lady brackenstall\\n      actually saw the three men drinking did she not\\n\\n      yes she was clear about that\\n\\n      then there is an end of it what more is to be said and yet\\n      you must admit that the three glasses are very remarkable\\n      hopkins what you see nothing remarkable well well let it\\n      pass perhaps when a man has special knowledge and special\\n      powers like my own it rather encourages him to seek a complex\\n      explanation when a simpler one is at hand of course it must be\\n      a mere chance about the glasses well goodmorning hopkins i\\n      dont see that i can be of any use to you and you appear to have\\n      your case very clear you will let me know when randall is\\n      arrested and any further developments which may occur i trust\\n      that i shall soon have to congratulate you upon a successful\\n      conclusion come watson i fancy that we may employ ourselves\\n      more profitably at home\\n\\n      during our return journey i could see by holmess face that he\\n      was much puzzled by something which he had observed every now\\n      and then by an effort he would throw off the impression and\\n      talk as if the matter were clear but then his doubts would\\n      settle down upon him again and his knitted brows and abstracted\\n      eyes would show that his thoughts had gone back once more to the\\n      great diningroom of the abbey grange in which this midnight\\n      tragedy had been enacted at last by a sudden impulse just as\\n      our train was crawling out of a suburban station he sprang on to\\n      the platform and pulled me out after him\\n\\n      excuse me my dear fellow said he as we watched the rear\\n      carriages of our train disappearing round a curve i am sorry to\\n      make you the victim of what may seem a mere whim but on my life\\n      watson i simply cant leave that case in this condition every\\n      instinct that i possess cries out against it its wrongits all\\n      wrongill swear that its wrong and yet the ladys story was\\n      complete the maids corroboration was sufficient the detail was\\n      fairly exact what have i to put up against that three\\n      wineglasses that is all but if i had not taken things for\\n      granted if i had examined everything with the care which i\\n      should have shown had we approached the case de novo and had no\\n      cutanddried story to warp my mind should i not then have found\\n      something more definite to go upon of course i should sit down\\n      on this bench watson until a train for chiselhurst arrives and\\n      allow me to lay the evidence before you imploring you in the\\n      first instance to dismiss from your mind the idea that anything\\n      which the maid or her mistress may have said must necessarily be\\n      true the ladys charming personality must not be permitted to\\n      warp our judgment\\n\\n      surely there are details in her story which if we looked at in\\n      cold blood would excite our suspicion these burglars made a\\n      considerable haul at sydenham a fortnight ago some account of\\n      them and of their appearance was in the papers and would\\n      naturally occur to anyone who wished to invent a story in which\\n      imaginary robbers should play a part as a matter of fact\\n      burglars who have done a good stroke of business are as a rule\\n      only too glad to enjoy the proceeds in peace and quiet without\\n      embarking on another perilous undertaking again it is unusual\\n      for burglars to operate at so early an hour it is unusual for\\n      burglars to strike a lady to prevent her screaming since one\\n      would imagine that was the sure way to make her scream it is\\n      unusual for them to commit murder when their numbers are\\n      sufficient to overpower one man it is unusual for them to be\\n      content with a limited plunder when there was much more within\\n      their reach and finally i should say that it was very unusual\\n      for such men to leave a bottle half empty how do all these\\n      unusuals strike you watson\\n\\n      their cumulative effect is certainly considerable and yet each\\n      of them is quite possible in itself the most unusual thing of\\n      all as it seems to me is that the lady should be tied to the\\n      chair\\n\\n      well i am not so clear about that watson for it is evident\\n      that they must either kill her or else secure her in such a way\\n      that she could not give immediate notice of their escape but at\\n      any rate i have shown have i not that there is a certain\\n      element of improbability about the ladys story and now on the\\n      top of this comes the incident of the wineglasses\\n\\n      what about the wineglasses\\n\\n      can you see them in your minds eye\\n\\n      i see them clearly\\n\\n      we are told that three men drank from them does that strike you\\n      as likely\\n\\n      why not there was wine in each glass\\n\\n      exactly but there was beeswing only in one glass you must have\\n      noticed that fact what does that suggest to your mind\\n\\n      the last glass filled would be most likely to contain beeswing\\n\\n      not at all the bottle was full of it and it is inconceivable\\n      that the first two glasses were clear and the third heavily\\n      charged with it there are two possible explanations and only\\n      two one is that after the second glass was filled the bottle was\\n      violently agitated and so the third glass received the beeswing\\n      that does not appear probable no no i am sure that i am\\n      right\\n\\n      what then do you suppose\\n\\n      that only two glasses were used and that the dregs of both were\\n      poured into a third glass so as to give the false impression\\n      that three people had been here in that way all the beeswing\\n      would be in the last glass would it not yes i am convinced\\n      that this is so but if i have hit upon the true explanation of\\n      this one small phenomenon then in an instant the case rises from\\n      the commonplace to the exceedingly remarkable for it can only\\n      mean that lady brackenstall and her maid have deliberately lied\\n      to us that not one word of their story is to be believed that\\n      they have some very strong reason for covering the real criminal\\n      and that we must construct our case for ourselves without any\\n      help from them that is the mission which now lies before us and\\n      here watson is the sydenham train\\n\\n      the household at the abbey grange were much surprised at our\\n      return but sherlock holmes finding that stanley hopkins had\\n      gone off to report to headquarters took possession of the\\n      diningroom locked the door upon the inside and devoted himself\\n      for two hours to one of those minute and laborious investigations\\n      which form the solid basis on which his brilliant edifices of\\n      deduction were reared seated in a corner like an interested\\n      student who observes the demonstration of his professor i\\n      followed every step of that remarkable research the window the\\n      curtains the carpet the chair the ropeeach in turn was\\n      minutely examined and duly pondered the body of the unfortunate\\n      baronet had been removed and all else remained as we had seen it\\n      in the morning finally to my astonishment holmes climbed up on\\n      to the massive mantelpiece far above his head hung the few\\n      inches of red cord which were still attached to the wire for a\\n      long time he gazed upward at it and then in an attempt to get\\n      nearer to it he rested his knee upon a wooden bracket on the\\n      wall this brought his hand within a few inches of the broken end\\n      of the rope but it was not this so much as the bracket itself\\n      which seemed to engage his attention finally he sprang down\\n      with an ejaculation of satisfaction\\n\\n      its all right watson said he we have got our caseone of\\n      the most remarkable in our collection but dear me how\\n      slowwitted i have been and how nearly i have committed the\\n      blunder of my lifetime now i think that with a few missing\\n      links my chain is almost complete\\n\\n      you have got your men\\n\\n      man watson man only one but a very formidable person strong\\n      as a lionwitness the blow that bent that poker six foot three\\n      in height active as a squirrel dexterous with his fingers\\n      finally remarkably quickwitted for this whole ingenious story\\n      is of his concoction yes watson we have come upon the\\n      handiwork of a very remarkable individual and yet in that\\n      bellrope he has given us a clue which should not have left us a\\n      doubt\\n\\n      where was the clue\\n\\n      well if you were to pull down a bellrope watson where would\\n      you expect it to break surely at the spot where it is attached\\n      to the wire why should it break three inches from the top as\\n      this one has done\\n\\n      because it is frayed there\\n\\n      exactly this end which we can examine is frayed he was\\n      cunning enough to do that with his knife but the other end is\\n      not frayed you could not observe that from here but if you were\\n      on the mantelpiece you would see that it is cut clean off without\\n      any mark of fraying whatever you can reconstruct what occurred\\n      the man needed the rope he would not tear it down for fear of\\n      giving the alarm by ringing the bell what did he do he sprang\\n      up on the mantelpiece could not quite reach it put his knee on\\n      the bracketyou will see the impression in the dustand so got\\n      his knife to bear upon the cord i could not reach the place by\\n      at least three inchesfrom which i infer that he is at least\\n      three inches a bigger man than i look at that mark upon the seat\\n      of the oaken chair what is it\\n\\n      blood\\n\\n      undoubtedly it is blood this alone puts the ladys story out of\\n      court if she were seated on the chair when the crime was done\\n      how comes that mark no no she was placed in the chair after\\n      the death of her husband ill wager that the black dress shows a\\n      corresponding mark to this we have not yet met our waterloo\\n      watson but this is our marengo for it begins in defeat and ends\\n      in victory i should like now to have a few words with the nurse\\n      theresa we must be wary for a while if we are to get the\\n      information which we want\\n\\n      she was an interesting person this stern australian\\n      nursetaciturn suspicious ungracious it took some time before\\n      holmess pleasant manner and frank acceptance of all that she\\n      said thawed her into a corresponding amiability she did not\\n      attempt to conceal her hatred for her late employer\\n\\n      yes sir it is true that he threw the decanter at me i heard\\n      him call my mistress a name and i told him that he would not\\n      dare to speak so if her brother had been there then it was that\\n      he threw it at me he might have thrown a dozen if he had but\\n      left my bonny bird alone he was forever illtreating her and\\n      she too proud to complain she will not even tell me all that he\\n      has done to her she never told me of those marks on her arm that\\n      you saw this morning but i know very well that they come from a\\n      stab with a hatpin the sly devilgod forgive me that i should\\n      speak of him so now that he is dead but a devil he was if ever\\n      one walked the earth he was all honey when first we met himonly\\n      eighteen months ago and we both feel as if it were eighteen\\n      years she had only just arrived in london yes it was her first\\n      voyageshe had never been from home before he won her with his\\n      title and his money and his false london ways if she made a\\n      mistake she has paid for it if ever a woman did what month did\\n      we meet him well i tell you it was just after we arrived we\\n      arrived in june and it was july they were married in january of\\n      last year yes she is down in the morningroom again and i have\\n      no doubt she will see you but you must not ask too much of her\\n      for she has gone through all that flesh and blood will stand\\n\\n      lady brackenstall was reclining on the same couch but looked\\n      brighter than before the maid had entered with us and began\\n      once more to foment the bruise upon her mistresss brow\\n\\n      i hope said the lady that you have not come to crossexamine\\n      me again\\n\\n      no holmes answered in his gentlest voice i will not cause\\n      you any unnecessary trouble lady brackenstall and my whole\\n      desire is to make things easy for you for i am convinced that\\n      you are a muchtried woman if you will treat me as a friend and\\n      trust me you may find that i will justify your trust\\n\\n      what do you want me to do\\n\\n      to tell me the truth\\n\\n      mr holmes\\n\\n      no no lady brackenstallit is no use you may have heard of\\n      any little reputation which i possess i will stake it all on the\\n      fact that your story is an absolute fabrication\\n\\n      mistress and maid were both staring at holmes with pale faces and\\n      frightened eyes\\n\\n      you are an impudent fellow cried theresa do you mean to say\\n      that my mistress has told a lie\\n\\n      holmes rose from his chair\\n\\n      have you nothing to tell me\\n\\n      i have told you everything\\n\\n      think once more lady brackenstall would it not be better to be\\n      frank\\n\\n      for an instant there was hesitation in her beautiful face then\\n      some new strong thought caused it to set like a mask\\n\\n      i have told you all i know\\n\\n      holmes took his hat and shrugged his shoulders i am sorry he\\n      said and without another word we left the room and the house\\n      there was a pond in the park and to this my friend led the way\\n      it was frozen over but a single hole was left for the\\n      convenience of a solitary swan holmes gazed at it and then\\n      passed on to the lodge gate there he scribbled a short note for\\n      stanley hopkins and left it with the lodgekeeper\\n\\n      it may be a hit or it may be a miss but we are bound to do\\n      something for friend hopkins just to justify this second visit\\n      said he i will not quite take him into my confidence yet i\\n      think our next scene of operations must be the shipping office of\\n      the adelaidesouthampton line which stands at the end of pall\\n      mall if i remember right there is a second line of steamers\\n      which connect south australia with england but we will draw the\\n      larger cover first\\n\\n      holmess card sent in to the manager ensured instant attention\\n      and he was not long in acquiring all the information he needed\\n      in june of  only one of their line had reached a home port\\n      it was the rock of gibraltar their largest and best boat a\\n      reference to the passenger list showed that miss fraser of\\n      adelaide with her maid had made the voyage in her the boat was\\n      now somewhere south of the suez canal on her way to australia\\n      her officers were the same as in  with one exception the\\n      first officer mr jack crocker had been made a captain and was\\n      to take charge of their new ship the bass rock sailing in two\\n      days time from southampton he lived at sydenham but he was\\n      likely to be in that morning for instructions if we cared to\\n      wait for him\\n\\n      no mr holmes had no desire to see him but would be glad to\\n      know more about his record and character\\n\\n      his record was magnificent there was not an officer in the fleet\\n      to touch him as to his character he was reliable on duty but a\\n      wild desperate fellow off the deck of his shiphotheaded\\n      excitable but loyal honest and kindhearted that was the pith\\n      of the information with which holmes left the office of the\\n      adelaidesouthampton company thence he drove to scotland yard\\n      but instead of entering he sat in his cab with his brows drawn\\n      down lost in profound thought finally he drove round to the\\n      charing cross telegraph office sent off a message and then at\\n      last we made for baker street once more\\n\\n      no i couldnt do it watson said he as we reentered our\\n      room once that warrant was made out nothing on earth would\\n      save him once or twice in my career i feel that i have done more\\n      real harm by my discovery of the criminal than ever he had done\\n      by his crime i have learned caution now and i had rather play\\n      tricks with the law of england than with my own conscience let\\n      us know a little more before we act\\n\\n      before evening we had a visit from inspector stanley hopkins\\n      things were not going very well with him\\n\\n      i believe that you are a wizard mr holmes i really do\\n      sometimes think that you have powers that are not human now how\\n      on earth could you know that the stolen silver was at the bottom\\n      of that pond\\n\\n      i didnt know it\\n\\n      but you told me to examine it\\n\\n      you got it then\\n\\n      yes i got it\\n\\n      i am very glad if i have helped you\\n\\n      but you havent helped me you have made the affair far more\\n      difficult what sort of burglars are they who steal silver and\\n      then throw it into the nearest pond\\n\\n      it was certainly rather eccentric behaviour i was merely going\\n      on the idea that if the silver had been taken by persons who did\\n      not want itwho merely took it for a blind as it werethen they\\n      would naturally be anxious to get rid of it\\n\\n      but why should such an idea cross your mind\\n\\n      well i thought it was possible when they came out through the\\n      french window there was the pond with one tempting little hole\\n      in the ice right in front of their noses could there be a\\n      better hidingplace\\n\\n      ah a hidingplacethat is better cried stanley hopkins yes\\n      yes i see it all now it was early there were folk upon the\\n      roads they were afraid of being seen with the silver so they\\n      sank it in the pond intending to return for it when the coast\\n      was clear excellent mr holmesthat is better than your idea of\\n      a blind\\n\\n      quite so you have got an admirable theory i have no doubt that\\n      my own ideas were quite wild but you must admit that they have\\n      ended in discovering the silver\\n\\n      yes siryes it was all your doing but i have had a bad\\n      setback\\n\\n      a setback\\n\\n      yes mr holmes the randall gang were arrested in new york this\\n      morning\\n\\n      dear me hopkins that is certainly rather against your theory\\n      that they committed a murder in kent last night\\n\\n      it is fatal mr holmesabsolutely fatal still there are other\\n      gangs of three besides the randalls or it may be some new gang\\n      of which the police have never heard\\n\\n      quite so it is perfectly possible what are you off\\n\\n      yes mr holmes there is no rest for me until i have got to the\\n      bottom of the business i suppose you have no hint to give me\\n\\n      i have given you one\\n\\n      which\\n\\n      well i suggested a blind\\n\\n      but why mr holmes why\\n\\n      ah thats the question of course but i commend the idea to\\n      your mind you might possibly find that there was something in\\n      it you wont stop for dinner well goodbye and let us know\\n      how you get on\\n\\n      dinner was over and the table cleared before holmes alluded to\\n      the matter again he had lit his pipe and held his slippered feet\\n      to the cheerful blaze of the fire suddenly he looked at his\\n      watch\\n\\n      i expect developments watson\\n\\n      when\\n\\n      nowwithin a few minutes i dare say you thought i acted rather\\n      badly to stanley hopkins just now\\n\\n      i trust your judgment\\n\\n      a very sensible reply watson you must look at it this way\\n      what i know is unofficial what he knows is official i have the\\n      right to private judgment but he has none he must disclose all\\n      or he is a traitor to his service in a doubtful case i would not\\n      put him in so painful a position and so i reserve my information\\n      until my own mind is clear upon the matter\\n\\n      but when will that be\\n\\n      the time has come you will now be present at the last scene of\\n      a remarkable little drama\\n\\n      there was a sound upon the stairs and our door was opened to\\n      admit as fine a specimen of manhood as ever passed through it he\\n      was a very tall young man goldenmoustached blueeyed with a\\n      skin which had been burned by tropical suns and a springy step\\n      which showed that the huge frame was as active as it was strong\\n      he closed the door behind him and then he stood with clenched\\n      hands and heaving breast choking down some overmastering\\n      emotion\\n\\n      sit down captain crocker you got my telegram\\n\\n      our visitor sank into an armchair and looked from one to the\\n      other of us with questioning eyes\\n\\n      i got your telegram and i came at the hour you said i heard\\n      that you had been down to the office there was no getting away\\n      from you lets hear the worst what are you going to do with me\\n      arrest me speak out man you cant sit there and play with me\\n      like a cat with a mouse\\n\\n      give him a cigar said holmes bite on that captain crocker\\n      and dont let your nerves run away with you i should not sit\\n      here smoking with you if i thought that you were a common\\n      criminal you may be sure of that be frank with me and we may do\\n      some good play tricks with me and ill crush you\\n\\n      what do you wish me to do\\n\\n      to give me a true account of all that happened at the abbey\\n      grange last nighta true account mind you with nothing added\\n      and nothing taken off i know so much already that if you go one\\n      inch off the straight ill blow this police whistle from my\\n      window and the affair goes out of my hands forever\\n\\n      the sailor thought for a little then he struck his leg with his\\n      great sunburned hand\\n\\n      ill chance it he cried i believe you are a man of your\\n      word and a white man and ill tell you the whole story but one\\n      thing i will say first so far as i am concerned i regret\\n      nothing and i fear nothing and i would do it all again and be\\n      proud of the job damn the beast if he had as many lives as a\\n      cat he would owe them all to me but its the lady marymary\\n      fraserfor never will i call her by that accursed name when i\\n      think of getting her into trouble i who would give my life just\\n      to bring one smile to her dear face its that that turns my soul\\n      into water and yetand yetwhat less could i do ill tell you\\n      my story gentlemen and then ill ask you as man to man what\\n      less could i do\\n\\n      i must go back a bit you seem to know everything so i expect\\n      that you know that i met her when she was a passenger and i was\\n      first officer of the rock of gibraltar from the first day i\\n      met her she was the only woman to me every day of that voyage i\\n      loved her more and many a time since have i kneeled down in the\\n      darkness of the night watch and kissed the deck of that ship\\n      because i knew her dear feet had trod it she was never engaged\\n      to me she treated me as fairly as ever a woman treated a man i\\n      have no complaint to make it was all love on my side and all\\n      good comradeship and friendship on hers when we parted she was a\\n      free woman but i could never again be a free man\\n\\n      next time i came back from sea i heard of her marriage well\\n      why shouldnt she marry whom she liked title and moneywho could\\n      carry them better than she she was born for all that is\\n      beautiful and dainty i didnt grieve over her marriage i was\\n      not such a selfish hound as that i just rejoiced that good luck\\n      had come her way and that she had not thrown herself away on a\\n      penniless sailor thats how i loved mary fraser\\n\\n      well i never thought to see her again but last voyage i was\\n      promoted and the new boat was not yet launched so i had to wait\\n      for a couple of months with my people at sydenham one day out in\\n      a country lane i met theresa wright her old maid she told me\\n      all about her about him about everything i tell you\\n      gentlemen it nearly drove me mad this drunken hound that he\\n      should dare to raise his hand to her whose boots he was not\\n      worthy to lick i met theresa again then i met mary herselfand\\n      met her again then she would meet me no more but the other day\\n      i had a notice that i was to start on my voyage within a week\\n      and i determined that i would see her once before i left theresa\\n      was always my friend for she loved mary and hated this villain\\n      almost as much as i did from her i learned the ways of the\\n      house mary used to sit up reading in her own little room\\n      downstairs i crept round there last night and scratched at the\\n      window at first she would not open to me but in her heart i\\n      know that now she loves me and she could not leave me in the\\n      frosty night she whispered to me to come round to the big front\\n      window and i found it open before me so as to let me into the\\n      diningroom again i heard from her own lips things that made my\\n      blood boil and again i cursed this brute who mishandled the\\n      woman i loved well gentlemen i was standing with her just\\n      inside the window in all innocence as god is my judge when he\\n      rushed like a madman into the room called her the vilest name\\n      that a man could use to a woman and welted her across the face\\n      with the stick he had in his hand i had sprung for the poker\\n      and it was a fair fight between us see here on my arm where\\n      his first blow fell then it was my turn and i went through him\\n      as if he had been a rotten pumpkin do you think i was sorry not\\n      i it was his life or mine but far more than that it was his\\n      life or hers for how could i leave her in the power of this\\n      madman that was how i killed him was i wrong well then what\\n      would either of you gentlemen have done if you had been in my\\n      position\\n\\n      she had screamed when he struck her and that brought old\\n      theresa down from the room above there was a bottle of wine on\\n      the sideboard and i opened it and poured a little between marys\\n      lips for she was half dead with shock then i took a drop\\n      myself theresa was as cool as ice and it was her plot as much\\n      as mine we must make it appear that burglars had done the thing\\n      theresa kept on repeating our story to her mistress while i\\n      swarmed up and cut the rope of the bell then i lashed her in her\\n      chair and frayed out the end of the rope to make it look\\n      natural else they would wonder how in the world a burglar could\\n      have got up there to cut it then i gathered up a few plates and\\n      pots of silver to carry out the idea of the robbery and there i\\n      left them with orders to give the alarm when i had a quarter of\\n      an hours start i dropped the silver into the pond and made off\\n      for sydenham feeling that for once in my life i had done a real\\n      good nights work and thats the truth and the whole truth mr\\n      holmes if it costs me my neck\\n\\n      holmes smoked for some time in silence then he crossed the room\\n      and shook our visitor by the hand\\n\\n      thats what i think said he i know that every word is true\\n      for you have hardly said a word which i did not know no one but\\n      an acrobat or a sailor could have got up to that bellrope from\\n      the bracket and no one but a sailor could have made the knots\\n      with which the cord was fastened to the chair only once had this\\n      lady been brought into contact with sailors and that was on her\\n      voyage and it was someone of her own class of life since she\\n      was trying hard to shield him and so showing that she loved him\\n      you see how easy it was for me to lay my hands upon you when once\\n      i had started upon the right trail\\n\\n      i thought the police never could have seen through our dodge\\n\\n      and the police havent nor will they to the best of my belief\\n      now look here captain crocker this is a very serious matter\\n      though i am willing to admit that you acted under the most\\n      extreme provocation to which any man could be subjected i am not\\n      sure that in defence of your own life your action will not be\\n      pronounced legitimate however that is for a british jury to\\n      decide meanwhile i have so much sympathy for you that if you\\n      choose to disappear in the next twentyfour hours i will promise\\n      you that no one will hinder you\\n\\n      and then it will all come out\\n\\n      certainly it will come out\\n\\n      the sailor flushed with anger\\n\\n      what sort of proposal is that to make a man i know enough of\\n      law to understand that mary would be held as accomplice do you\\n      think i would leave her alone to face the music while i slunk\\n      away no sir let them do their worst upon me but for heavens\\n      sake mr holmes find some way of keeping my poor mary out of\\n      the courts\\n\\n      holmes for a second time held out his hand to the sailor\\n\\n      i was only testing you and you ring true every time well it\\n      is a great responsibility that i take upon myself but i have\\n      given hopkins an excellent hint and if he cant avail himself of\\n      it i can do no more see here captain crocker well do this in\\n      due form of law you are the prisoner watson you are a british\\n      jury and i never met a man who was more eminently fitted to\\n      represent one i am the judge now gentleman of the jury you\\n      have heard the evidence do you find the prisoner guilty or not\\n      guilty\\n\\n      not guilty my lord said i\\n\\n      vox populi vox dei you are acquitted captain crocker so\\n      long as the law does not find some other victim you are safe from\\n      me come back to this lady in a year and may her future and\\n      yours justify us in the judgment which we have pronounced this\\n      night\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe adventure of the second stain\\n\\n\\n      i had intended the adventure of the abbey grange to be the last\\n      of those exploits of my friend mr sherlock holmes which i\\n      should ever communicate to the public this resolution of mine\\n      was not due to any lack of material since i have notes of many\\n      hundreds of cases to which i have never alluded nor was it\\n      caused by any waning interest on the part of my readers in the\\n      singular personality and unique methods of this remarkable man\\n      the real reason lay in the reluctance which mr holmes has shown\\n      to the continued publication of his experiences so long as he\\n      was in actual professional practice the records of his successes\\n      were of some practical value to him but since he has definitely\\n      retired from london and betaken himself to study and beefarming\\n      on the sussex downs notoriety has become hateful to him and he\\n      has peremptorily requested that his wishes in this matter should\\n      be strictly observed it was only upon my representing to him\\n      that i had given a promise that the adventure of the second\\n      stain should be published when the times were ripe and pointing\\n      out to him that it is only appropriate that this long series of\\n      episodes should culminate in the most important international\\n      case which he has ever been called upon to handle that i at last\\n      succeeded in obtaining his consent that a carefully guarded\\n      account of the incident should at last be laid before the public\\n      if in telling the story i seem to be somewhat vague in certain\\n      details the public will readily understand that there is an\\n      excellent reason for my reticence\\n\\n      it was then in a year and even in a decade that shall be\\n      nameless that upon one tuesday morning in autumn we found two\\n      visitors of european fame within the walls of our humble room in\\n      baker street the one austere highnosed eagleeyed and\\n      dominant was none other than the illustrious lord bellinger\\n      twice premier of britain the other dark clearcut and\\n      elegant hardly yet of middle age and endowed with every beauty\\n      of body and of mind was the right honourable trelawney hope\\n      secretary for european affairs and the most rising statesman in\\n      the country they sat side by side upon our paperlittered\\n      settee and it was easy to see from their worn and anxious faces\\n      that it was business of the most pressing importance which had\\n      brought them the premiers thin blueveined hands were clasped\\n      tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella and his gaunt\\n      ascetic face looked gloomily from holmes to me the european\\n      secretary pulled nervously at his moustache and fidgeted with the\\n      seals of his watchchain\\n\\n      when i discovered my loss mr holmes which was at eight\\n      oclock this morning i at once informed the prime minister it\\n      was at his suggestion that we have both come to you\\n\\n      have you informed the police\\n\\n      no sir said the prime minister with the quick decisive\\n      manner for which he was famous we have not done so nor is it\\n      possible that we should do so to inform the police must in the\\n      long run mean to inform the public this is what we particularly\\n      desire to avoid\\n\\n      and why sir\\n\\n      because the document in question is of such immense importance\\n      that its publication might very easilyi might almost say\\n      probablylead to european complications of the utmost moment it\\n      is not too much to say that peace or war may hang upon the issue\\n      unless its recovery can be attended with the utmost secrecy then\\n      it may as well not be recovered at all for all that is aimed at\\n      by those who have taken it is that its contents should be\\n      generally known\\n\\n      i understand now mr trelawney hope i should be much obliged\\n      if you would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this\\n      document disappeared\\n\\n      that can be done in a very few words mr holmes the letterfor\\n      it was a letter from a foreign potentatewas received six days\\n      ago it was of such importance that i have never left it in my\\n      safe but have taken it across each evening to my house in\\n      whitehall terrace and kept it in my bedroom in a locked\\n      despatchbox it was there last night of that i am certain i\\n      actually opened the box while i was dressing for dinner and saw\\n      the document inside this morning it was gone the despatchbox\\n      had stood beside the glass upon my dressingtable all night i am\\n      a light sleeper and so is my wife we are both prepared to swear\\n      that no one could have entered the room during the night and yet\\n      i repeat that the paper is gone\\n\\n      what time did you dine\\n\\n      halfpast seven\\n\\n      how long was it before you went to bed\\n\\n      my wife had gone to the theatre i waited up for her it was\\n      halfpast eleven before we went to our room\\n\\n      then for four hours the despatchbox had lain unguarded\\n\\n      no one is ever permitted to enter that room save the housemaid\\n      in the morning and my valet or my wifes maid during the rest\\n      of the day they are both trusty servants who have been with us\\n      for some time besides neither of them could possibly have known\\n      that there was anything more valuable than the ordinary\\n      departmental papers in my despatchbox\\n\\n      who did know of the existence of that letter\\n\\n      no one in the house\\n\\n      surely your wife knew\\n\\n      no sir i had said nothing to my wife until i missed the paper\\n      this morning\\n\\n      the premier nodded approvingly\\n\\n      i have long known sir how high is your sense of public duty\\n      said he i am convinced that in the case of a secret of this\\n      importance it would rise superior to the most intimate domestic\\n      ties\\n\\n      the european secretary bowed\\n\\n      you do me no more than justice sir until this morning i have\\n      never breathed one word to my wife upon this matter\\n\\n      could she have guessed\\n\\n      no mr holmes she could not have guessednor could anyone have\\n      guessed\\n\\n      have you lost any documents before\\n\\n      no sir\\n\\n      who is there in england who did know of the existence of this\\n      letter\\n\\n      each member of the cabinet was informed of it yesterday but the\\n      pledge of secrecy which attends every cabinet meeting was\\n      increased by the solemn warning which was given by the prime\\n      minister good heavens to think that within a few hours i should\\n      myself have lost it his handsome face was distorted with a\\n      spasm of despair and his hands tore at his hair for a moment we\\n      caught a glimpse of the natural man impulsive ardent keenly\\n      sensitive the next the aristocratic mask was replaced and the\\n      gentle voice had returned besides the members of the cabinet\\n      there are two or possibly three departmental officials who know\\n      of the letter no one else in england mr holmes i assure you\\n\\n      but abroad\\n\\n      i believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote\\n      it i am well convinced that his ministersthat the usual\\n      official channels have not been employed\\n\\n      holmes considered for some little time\\n\\n      now sir i must ask you more particularly what this document\\n      is and why its disappearance should have such momentous\\n      consequences\\n\\n      the two statesmen exchanged a quick glance and the premiers\\n      shaggy eyebrows gathered in a frown\\n\\n      mr holmes the envelope is a long thin one of pale blue\\n      colour there is a seal of red wax stamped with a crouching lion\\n      it is addressed in large bold handwriting to\\n\\n      i fear sir said holmes that interesting and indeed\\n      essential as these details are my inquiries must go more to the\\n      root of things what was the letter\\n\\n      that is a state secret of the utmost importance and i fear that\\n      i cannot tell you nor do i see that it is necessary if by the\\n      aid of the powers which you are said to possess you can find such\\n      an envelope as i describe with its enclosure you will have\\n      deserved well of your country and earned any reward which it\\n      lies in our power to bestow\\n\\n      sherlock holmes rose with a smile\\n\\n      you are two of the most busy men in the country said he and\\n      in my own small way i have also a good many calls upon me i\\n      regret exceedingly that i cannot help you in this matter and any\\n      continuation of this interview would be a waste of time\\n\\n      the premier sprang to his feet with that quick fierce gleam of\\n      his deepset eyes before which a cabinet has cowered i am not\\n      accustomed sir he began but mastered his anger and resumed\\n      his seat for a minute or more we all sat in silence then the\\n      old statesman shrugged his shoulders\\n\\n      we must accept your terms mr holmes no doubt you are right\\n      and it is unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless we give\\n      you our entire confidence\\n\\n      i agree with you said the younger statesman\\n\\n      then i will tell you relying entirely upon your honour and that\\n      of your colleague dr watson i may appeal to your patriotism\\n      also for i could not imagine a greater misfortune for the\\n      country than that this affair should come out\\n\\n      you may safely trust us\\n\\n      the letter then is from a certain foreign potentate who has\\n      been ruffled by some recent colonial developments of this\\n      country it has been written hurriedly and upon his own\\n      responsibility entirely inquiries have shown that his ministers\\n      know nothing of the matter at the same time it is couched in so\\n      unfortunate a manner and certain phrases in it are of so\\n      provocative a character that its publication would undoubtedly\\n      lead to a most dangerous state of feeling in this country there\\n      would be such a ferment sir that i do not hesitate to say that\\n      within a week of the publication of that letter this country\\n      would be involved in a great war\\n\\n      holmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and handed it to the\\n      premier\\n\\n      exactly it was he and it is this letterthis letter which may\\n      well mean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the lives of\\n      a hundred thousand menwhich has become lost in this\\n      unaccountable fashion\\n\\n      have you informed the sender\\n\\n      yes sir a cipher telegram has been despatched\\n\\n      perhaps he desires the publication of the letter\\n\\n      no sir we have strong reason to believe that he already\\n      understands that he has acted in an indiscreet and hotheaded\\n      manner it would be a greater blow to him and to his country than\\n      to us if this letter were to come out\\n\\n      if this is so whose interest is it that the letter should come\\n      out why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it\\n\\n      there mr holmes you take me into regions of high\\n      international politics but if you consider the european\\n      situation you will have no difficulty in perceiving the motive\\n      the whole of europe is an armed camp there is a double league\\n      which makes a fair balance of military power great britain holds\\n      the scales if britain were driven into war with one confederacy\\n      it would assure the supremacy of the other confederacy whether\\n      they joined in the war or not do you follow\\n\\n      very clearly it is then the interest of the enemies of this\\n      potentate to secure and publish this letter so as to make a\\n      breach between his country and ours\\n\\n      yes sir\\n\\n      and to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the\\n      hands of an enemy\\n\\n      to any of the great chancelleries of europe it is probably\\n      speeding on its way thither at the present instant as fast as\\n      steam can take it\\n\\n      mr trelawney hope dropped his head on his chest and groaned\\n      aloud the premier placed his hand kindly upon his shoulder\\n\\n      it is your misfortune my dear fellow no one can blame you\\n      there is no precaution which you have neglected now mr holmes\\n      you are in full possession of the facts what course do you\\n      recommend\\n\\n      holmes shook his head mournfully\\n\\n      you think sir that unless this document is recovered there\\n      will be war\\n\\n      i think it is very probable\\n\\n      then sir prepare for war\\n\\n      that is a hard saying mr holmes\\n\\n      consider the facts sir it is inconceivable that it was taken\\n      after eleventhirty at night since i understand that mr hope\\n      and his wife were both in the room from that hour until the loss\\n      was found out it was taken then yesterday evening between\\n      seventhirty and eleventhirty probably near the earlier hour\\n      since whoever took it evidently knew that it was there and would\\n      naturally secure it as early as possible now sir if a document\\n      of this importance were taken at that hour where can it be now\\n      no one has any reason to retain it it has been passed rapidly on\\n      to those who need it what chance have we now to overtake or even\\n      to trace it it is beyond our reach\\n\\n      the prime minister rose from the settee\\n\\n      what you say is perfectly logical mr holmes i feel that the\\n      matter is indeed out of our hands\\n\\n      let us presume for arguments sake that the document was taken\\n      by the maid or by the valet\\n\\n      they are both old and tried servants\\n\\n      i understand you to say that your room is on the second floor\\n      that there is no entrance from without and that from within no\\n      one could go up unobserved it must then be somebody in the\\n      house who has taken it to whom would the thief take it to one\\n      of several international spies and secret agents whose names are\\n      tolerably familiar to me there are three who may be said to be\\n      the heads of their profession i will begin my research by going\\n      round and finding if each of them is at his post if one is\\n      missingespecially if he has disappeared since last nightwe will\\n      have some indication as to where the document has gone\\n\\n      why should he be missing asked the european secretary he\\n      would take the letter to an embassy in london as likely as not\\n\\n      i fancy not these agents work independently and their\\n      relations with the embassies are often strained\\n\\n      the prime minister nodded his acquiescence\\n\\n      i believe you are right mr holmes he would take so valuable a\\n      prize to headquarters with his own hands i think that your\\n      course of action is an excellent one meanwhile hope we cannot\\n      neglect all our other duties on account of this one misfortune\\n      should there be any fresh developments during the day we shall\\n      communicate with you and you will no doubt let us know the\\n      results of your own inquiries\\n\\n      the two statesmen bowed and walked gravely from the room\\n\\n      when our illustrious visitors had departed holmes lit his pipe in\\n      silence and sat for some time lost in the deepest thought i had\\n      opened the morning paper and was immersed in a sensational crime\\n      which had occurred in london the night before when my friend\\n      gave an exclamation sprang to his feet and laid his pipe down\\n      upon the mantelpiece\\n\\n      yes said he there is no better way of approaching it the\\n      situation is desperate but not hopeless even now if we could\\n      be sure which of them has taken it it is just possible that it\\n      has not yet passed out of his hands after all it is a question\\n      of money with these fellows and i have the british treasury\\n      behind me if its on the market ill buy itif it means another\\n      penny on the incometax it is conceivable that the fellow might\\n      hold it back to see what bids come from this side before he tries\\n      his luck on the other there are only those three capable of\\n      playing so bold a gamethere are oberstein la rothiere and\\n      eduardo lucas i will see each of them\\n\\n      i glanced at my morning paper\\n\\n      is that eduardo lucas of godolphin street\\n\\n      yes\\n\\n      you will not see him\\n\\n      why not\\n\\n      he was murdered in his house last night\\n\\n      my friend has so often astonished me in the course of our\\n      adventures that it was with a sense of exultation that i realized\\n      how completely i had astonished him he stared in amazement and\\n      then snatched the paper from my hands this was the paragraph\\n      which i had been engaged in reading when he rose from his chair\\n\\n      murder in westminster\\n\\n      a crime of mysterious character was committed last night at \\n      godolphin street one of the oldfashioned and secluded rows of\\n      eighteenth century houses which lie between the river and the\\n      abbey almost in the shadow of the great tower of the houses of\\n      parliament this small but select mansion has been inhabited for\\n      some years by mr eduardo lucas wellknown in society circles\\n      both on account of his charming personality and because he has\\n      the welldeserved reputation of being one of the best amateur\\n      tenors in the country mr lucas is an unmarried man thirtyfour\\n      years of age and his establishment consists of mrs pringle an\\n      elderly housekeeper and of mitton his valet the former retires\\n      early and sleeps at the top of the house the valet was out for\\n      the evening visiting a friend at hammersmith from ten oclock\\n      onward mr lucas had the house to himself what occurred during\\n      that time has not yet transpired but at a quarter to twelve\\n      policeconstable barrett passing along godolphin street observed\\n      that the door of no  was ajar he knocked but received no\\n      answer perceiving a light in the front room he advanced into\\n      the passage and again knocked but without reply he then pushed\\n      open the door and entered the room was in a state of wild\\n      disorder the furniture being all swept to one side and one\\n      chair lying on its back in the centre beside this chair and\\n      still grasping one of its legs lay the unfortunate tenant of the\\n      house he had been stabbed to the heart and must have died\\n      instantly the knife with which the crime had been committed was\\n      a curved indian dagger plucked down from a trophy of oriental\\n      arms which adorned one of the walls robbery does not appear to\\n      have been the motive of the crime for there had been no attempt\\n      to remove the valuable contents of the room mr eduardo lucas\\n      was so wellknown and popular that his violent and mysterious\\n      fate will arouse painful interest and intense sympathy in a\\n      widespread circle of friends\\n\\n      well watson what do you make of this asked holmes after a\\n      long pause\\n\\n      it is an amazing coincidence\\n\\n      a coincidence here is one of the three men whom we had named as\\n      possible actors in this drama and he meets a violent death\\n      during the very hours when we know that that drama was being\\n      enacted the odds are enormous against its being coincidence no\\n      figures could express them no my dear watson the two events\\n      are connectedmust be connected it is for us to find the\\n      connection\\n\\n      but now the official police must know all\\n\\n      not at all they know all they see at godolphin street they\\n      knowand shall knownothing of whitehall terrace only we know\\n      of both events and can trace the relation between them there is\\n      one obvious point which would in any case have turned my\\n      suspicions against lucas godolphin street westminster is only\\n      a few minutes walk from whitehall terrace the other secret\\n      agents whom i have named live in the extreme west end it was\\n      easier therefore for lucas than for the others to establish a\\n      connection or receive a message from the european secretarys\\n      householda small thing and yet where events are compressed into\\n      a few hours it may prove essential halloa what have we here\\n\\n      mrs hudson had appeared with a ladys card upon her salver\\n      holmes glanced at it raised his eyebrows and handed it over to\\n      me\\n\\n      ask lady hilda trelawney hope if she will be kind enough to step\\n      up said he\\n\\n      a moment later our modest apartment already so distinguished\\n      that morning was further honoured by the entrance of the most\\n      lovely woman in london i had often heard of the beauty of the\\n      youngest daughter of the duke of belminster but no description\\n      of it and no contemplation of colourless photographs had\\n      prepared me for the subtle delicate charm and the beautiful\\n      colouring of that exquisite head and yet as we saw it that\\n      autumn morning it was not its beauty which would be the first\\n      thing to impress the observer the cheek was lovely but it was\\n      paled with emotion the eyes were bright but it was the\\n      brightness of fever the sensitive mouth was tight and drawn in\\n      an effort after selfcommand terrornot beautywas what sprang\\n      first to the eye as our fair visitor stood framed for an instant\\n      in the open door\\n\\n      has my husband been here mr holmes\\n\\n      yes madam he has been here\\n\\n      mr holmes i implore you not to tell him that i came here\\n      holmes bowed coldly and motioned the lady to a chair\\n\\n      your ladyship places me in a very delicate position i beg that\\n      you will sit down and tell me what you desire but i fear that i\\n      cannot make any unconditional promise\\n\\n      she swept across the room and seated herself with her back to the\\n      window it was a queenly presencetall graceful and intensely\\n      womanly mr holmes she saidand her whitegloved hands\\n      clasped and unclasped as she spokei will speak frankly to you\\n      in the hopes that it may induce you to speak frankly in return\\n      there is complete confidence between my husband and me on all\\n      matters save one that one is politics on this his lips are\\n      sealed he tells me nothing now i am aware that there was a\\n      most deplorable occurrence in our house last night i know that a\\n      paper has disappeared but because the matter is political my\\n      husband refuses to take me into his complete confidence now it\\n      is essentialessential i saythat i should thoroughly understand\\n      it you are the only other person save only these politicians\\n      who knows the true facts i beg you then mr holmes to tell me\\n      exactly what has happened and what it will lead to tell me all\\n      mr holmes let no regard for your clients interests keep you\\n      silent for i assure you that his interests if he would only see\\n      it would be best served by taking me into his complete\\n      confidence what was this paper which was stolen\\n\\n      madam what you ask me is really impossible\\n\\n      she groaned and sank her face in her hands\\n\\n      you must see that this is so madam if your husband thinks fit\\n      to keep you in the dark over this matter is it for me who has\\n      only learned the true facts under the pledge of professional\\n      secrecy to tell what he has withheld it is not fair to ask it\\n      it is him whom you must ask\\n\\n      i have asked him i come to you as a last resource but without\\n      your telling me anything definite mr holmes you may do a great\\n      service if you would enlighten me on one point\\n\\n      what is it madam\\n\\n      is my husbands political career likely to suffer through this\\n      incident\\n\\n      well madam unless it is set right it may certainly have a very\\n      unfortunate effect\\n\\n      ah she drew in her breath sharply as one whose doubts are\\n      resolved\\n\\n      one more question mr holmes from an expression which my\\n      husband dropped in the first shock of this disaster i understood\\n      that terrible public consequences might arise from the loss of\\n      this document\\n\\n      if he said so i certainly cannot deny it\\n\\n      of what nature are they\\n\\n      nay madam there again you ask me more than i can possibly\\n      answer\\n\\n      then i will take up no more of your time i cannot blame you\\n      mr holmes for having refused to speak more freely and you on\\n      your side will not i am sure think the worse of me because i\\n      desire even against his will to share my husbands anxieties\\n      once more i beg that you will say nothing of my visit\\n\\n      she looked back at us from the door and i had a last impression\\n      of that beautiful haunted face the startled eyes and the drawn\\n      mouth then she was gone\\n\\n      now watson the fair sex is your department said holmes with\\n      a smile when the dwindling froufrou of skirts had ended in\\n      the slam of the front door what was the fair ladys game what\\n      did she really want\\n\\n      surely her own statement is clear and her anxiety very natural\\n\\n      hum think of her appearance watsonher manner her suppressed\\n      excitement her restlessness her tenacity in asking questions\\n      remember that she comes of a caste who do not lightly show\\n      emotion\\n\\n      she was certainly much moved\\n\\n      remember also the curious earnestness with which she assured us\\n      that it was best for her husband that she should know all what\\n      did she mean by that and you must have observed watson how she\\n      manuvred to have the light at her back she did not wish us to\\n      read her expression\\n\\n      yes she chose the one chair in the room\\n\\n      and yet the motives of women are so inscrutable you remember\\n      the woman at margate whom i suspected for the same reason no\\n      powder on her nosethat proved to be the correct solution how\\n      can you build on such a quicksand their most trivial action may\\n      mean volumes or their most extraordinary conduct may depend upon\\n      a hairpin or a curling tongs goodmorning watson\\n\\n      you are off\\n\\n      yes i will while away the morning at godolphin street with our\\n      friends of the regular establishment with eduardo lucas lies the\\n      solution of our problem though i must admit that i have not an\\n      inkling as to what form it may take it is a capital mistake to\\n      theorize in advance of the facts do you stay on guard my good\\n      watson and receive any fresh visitors ill join you at lunch if\\n      i am able\\n\\n      all that day and the next and the next holmes was in a mood which\\n      his friends would call taciturn and others morose he ran out\\n      and ran in smoked incessantly played snatches on his violin\\n      sank into reveries devoured sandwiches at irregular hours and\\n      hardly answered the casual questions which i put to him it was\\n      evident to me that things were not going well with him or his\\n      quest he would say nothing of the case and it was from the\\n      papers that i learned the particulars of the inquest and the\\n      arrest with the subsequent release of john mitton the valet of\\n      the deceased the coroners jury brought in the obvious wilful\\n      murder but the parties remained as unknown as ever no motive\\n      was suggested the room was full of articles of value but none\\n      had been taken the dead mans papers had not been tampered with\\n      they were carefully examined and showed that he was a keen\\n      student of international politics an indefatigable gossip a\\n      remarkable linguist and an untiring letter writer he had been\\n      on intimate terms with the leading politicians of several\\n      countries but nothing sensational was discovered among the\\n      documents which filled his drawers as to his relations with\\n      women they appeared to have been promiscuous but superficial he\\n      had many acquaintances among them but few friends and no one\\n      whom he loved his habits were regular his conduct inoffensive\\n      his death was an absolute mystery and likely to remain so\\n\\n      as to the arrest of john mitton the valet it was a council of\\n      despair as an alternative to absolute inaction but no case could\\n      be sustained against him he had visited friends in hammersmith\\n      that night the alibi was complete it is true that he started\\n      home at an hour which should have brought him to westminster\\n      before the time when the crime was discovered but his own\\n      explanation that he had walked part of the way seemed probable\\n      enough in view of the fineness of the night he had actually\\n      arrived at twelve oclock and appeared to be overwhelmed by the\\n      unexpected tragedy he had always been on good terms with his\\n      master several of the dead mans possessionsnotably a small\\n      case of razorshad been found in the valets boxes but he\\n      explained that they had been presents from the deceased and the\\n      housekeeper was able to corroborate the story mitton had been in\\n      lucass employment for three years it was noticeable that lucas\\n      did not take mitton on the continent with him sometimes he\\n      visited paris for three months on end but mitton was left in\\n      charge of the godolphin street house as to the housekeeper she\\n      had heard nothing on the night of the crime if her master had a\\n      visitor he had himself admitted him\\n\\n      so for three mornings the mystery remained so far as i could\\n      follow it in the papers if holmes knew more he kept his own\\n      counsel but as he told me that inspector lestrade had taken him\\n      into his confidence in the case i knew that he was in close\\n      touch with every development upon the fourth day there appeared\\n      a long telegram from paris which seemed to solve the whole\\n      question\\n\\n      a discovery has just been made by the parisian police said the\\n      daily telegraph which raises the veil which hung round the\\n      tragic fate of mr eduardo lucas who met his death by violence\\n      last monday night at godolphin street westminster our readers\\n      will remember that the deceased gentleman was found stabbed in\\n      his room and that some suspicion attached to his valet but that\\n      the case broke down on an alibi yesterday a lady who has been\\n      known as mme henri fournaye occupying a small villa in the rue\\n      austerlitz was reported to the authorities by her servants as\\n      being insane an examination showed she had indeed developed\\n      mania of a dangerous and permanent form on inquiry the police\\n      have discovered that mme henri fournaye only returned from a\\n      journey to london on tuesday last and there is evidence to\\n      connect her with the crime at westminster a comparison of\\n      photographs has proved conclusively that m henri fournaye and\\n      eduardo lucas were really one and the same person and that the\\n      deceased had for some reason lived a double life in london and\\n      paris mme fournaye who is of creole origin is of an extremely\\n      excitable nature and has suffered in the past from attacks of\\n      jealousy which have amounted to frenzy it is conjectured that it\\n      was in one of these that she committed the terrible crime which\\n      has caused such a sensation in london her movements upon the\\n      monday night have not yet been traced but it is undoubted that a\\n      woman answering to her description attracted much attention at\\n      charing cross station on tuesday morning by the wildness of her\\n      appearance and the violence of her gestures it is probable\\n      therefore that the crime was either committed when insane or\\n      that its immediate effect was to drive the unhappy woman out of\\n      her mind at present she is unable to give any coherent account\\n      of the past and the doctors hold out no hopes of the\\n      reestablishment of her reason there is evidence that a woman\\n      who might have been mme fournaye was seen for some hours upon\\n      monday night watching the house in godolphin street\\n\\n      what do you think of that holmes i had read the account aloud\\n      to him while he finished his breakfast\\n\\n      my dear watson said he as he rose from the table and paced up\\n      and down the room you are most longsuffering but if i have\\n      told you nothing in the last three days it is because there is\\n      nothing to tell even now this report from paris does not help us\\n      much\\n\\n      surely it is final as regards the mans death\\n\\n      the mans death is a mere incidenta trivial episodein\\n      comparison with our real task which is to trace this document\\n      and save a european catastrophe only one important thing has\\n      happened in the last three days and that is that nothing has\\n      happened i get reports almost hourly from the government and it\\n      is certain that nowhere in europe is there any sign of trouble\\n      now if this letter were looseno it cant be loosebut if it\\n      isnt loose where can it be who has it why is it held back\\n      thats the question that beats in my brain like a hammer was it\\n      indeed a coincidence that lucas should meet his death on the\\n      night when the letter disappeared did the letter ever reach him\\n      if so why is it not among his papers did this mad wife of his\\n      carry it off with her if so is it in her house in paris how\\n      could i search for it without the french police having their\\n      suspicions aroused it is a case my dear watson where the law\\n      is as dangerous to us as the criminals are every mans hand is\\n      against us and yet the interests at stake are colossal should i\\n      bring it to a successful conclusion it will certainly represent\\n      the crowning glory of my career ah here is my latest from the\\n      front he glanced hurriedly at the note which had been handed\\n      in halloa lestrade seems to have observed something of\\n      interest put on your hat watson and we will stroll down\\n      together to westminster\\n\\n      it was my first visit to the scene of the crimea high dingy\\n      narrowchested house prim formal and solid like the century\\n      which gave it birth lestrades bulldog features gazed out at us\\n      from the front window and he greeted us warmly when a big\\n      constable had opened the door and let us in the room into which\\n      we were shown was that in which the crime had been committed but\\n      no trace of it now remained save an ugly irregular stain upon\\n      the carpet this carpet was a small square drugget in the centre\\n      of the room surrounded by a broad expanse of beautiful\\n      oldfashioned woodflooring in square blocks highly polished\\n      over the fireplace was a magnificent trophy of weapons one of\\n      which had been used on that tragic night in the window was a\\n      sumptuous writingdesk and every detail of the apartment the\\n      pictures the rugs and the hangings all pointed to a taste\\n      which was luxurious to the verge of effeminacy\\n\\n      seen the paris news asked lestrade\\n\\n      holmes nodded\\n\\n      our french friends seem to have touched the spot this time no\\n      doubt its just as they say she knocked at the doorsurprise\\n      visit i guess for he kept his life in watertight\\n      compartmentshe let her in couldnt keep her in the street she\\n      told him how she had traced him reproached him one thing led to\\n      another and then with that dagger so handy the end soon came it\\n      wasnt all done in an instant though for these chairs were all\\n      swept over yonder and he had one in his hand as if he had tried\\n      to hold her off with it weve got it all clear as if we had seen\\n      it\\n\\n      holmes raised his eyebrows\\n\\n      and yet you have sent for me\\n\\n      ah yes thats another mattera mere trifle but the sort of\\n      thing you take an interest inqueer you know and what you might\\n      call freakish it has nothing to do with the main factcant\\n      have on the face of it\\n\\n      what is it then\\n\\n      well you know after a crime of this sort we are very careful\\n      to keep things in their position nothing has been moved officer\\n      in charge here day and night this morning as the man was buried\\n      and the investigation overso far as this room is concernedwe\\n      thought we could tidy up a bit this carpet you see it is not\\n      fastened down only just laid there we had occasion to raise it\\n      we found\\n\\n      yes you found\\n\\n      holmess face grew tense with anxiety\\n\\n      well im sure you would never guess in a hundred years what we\\n      did find you see that stain on the carpet well a great deal\\n      must have soaked through must it not\\n\\n      undoubtedly it must\\n\\n      well you will be surprised to hear that there is no stain on\\n      the white woodwork to correspond\\n\\n      no stain but there must\\n\\n      yes so you would say but the fact remains that there isnt\\n\\n      he took the corner of the carpet in his hand and turning it\\n      over he showed that it was indeed as he said\\n\\n      but the under side is as stained as the upper it must have left\\n      a mark\\n\\n      lestrade chuckled with delight at having puzzled the famous\\n      expert\\n\\n      now ill show you the explanation there is a second stain\\n      but it does not correspond with the other see for yourself as\\n      he spoke he turned over another portion of the carpet and there\\n      sure enough was a great crimson spill upon the square white\\n      facing of the oldfashioned floor what do you make of that mr\\n      holmes\\n\\n      why it is simple enough the two stains did correspond but the\\n      carpet has been turned round as it was square and unfastened it\\n      was easily done\\n\\n      the official police dont need you mr holmes to tell them\\n      that the carpet must have been turned round thats clear enough\\n      for the stains lie above each otherif you lay it over this way\\n      but what i want to know is who shifted the carpet and why\\n\\n      i could see from holmess rigid face that he was vibrating with\\n      inward excitement\\n\\n      look here lestrade said he has that constable in the\\n      passage been in charge of the place all the time\\n\\n      yes he has\\n\\n      well take my advice examine him carefully dont do it before\\n      us well wait here you take him into the back room youll be\\n      more likely to get a confession out of him alone ask him how he\\n      dared to admit people and leave them alone in this room dont\\n      ask him if he has done it take it for granted tell him you\\n      know someone has been here press him tell him that a full\\n      confession is his only chance of forgiveness do exactly what i\\n      tell you\\n\\n      by george if he knows ill have it out of him cried lestrade\\n      he darted into the hall and a few moments later his bullying\\n      voice sounded from the back room\\n\\n      now watson now cried holmes with frenzied eagerness all the\\n      demoniacal force of the man masked behind that listless manner\\n      burst out in a paroxysm of energy he tore the drugget from the\\n      floor and in an instant was down on his hands and knees clawing\\n      at each of the squares of wood beneath it one turned sideways as\\n      he dug his nails into the edge of it it hinged back like the lid\\n      of a box a small black cavity opened beneath it holmes plunged\\n      his eager hand into it and drew it out with a bitter snarl of\\n      anger and disappointment it was empty\\n\\n      quick watson quick get it back again the wooden lid was\\n      replaced and the drugget had only just been drawn straight when\\n      lestrades voice was heard in the passage he found holmes\\n      leaning languidly against the mantelpiece resigned and patient\\n      endeavouring to conceal his irrepressible yawns\\n\\n      sorry to keep you waiting mr holmes i can see that you are\\n      bored to death with the whole affair well he has confessed all\\n      right come in here macpherson let these gentlemen hear of your\\n      most inexcusable conduct\\n\\n      the big constable very hot and penitent sidled into the room\\n\\n      i meant no harm sir im sure the young woman came to the door\\n      last eveningmistook the house she did and then we got talking\\n      its lonesome when youre on duty here all day\\n\\n      well what happened then\\n\\n      she wanted to see where the crime was donehad read about it in\\n      the papers she said she was a very respectable wellspoken\\n      young woman sir and i saw no harm in letting her have a peep\\n      when she saw that mark on the carpet down she dropped on the\\n      floor and lay as if she were dead i ran to the back and got\\n      some water but i could not bring her to then i went round the\\n      corner to the ivy plant for some brandy and by the time i had\\n      brought it back the young woman had recovered and was offashamed\\n      of herself i daresay and dared not face me\\n\\n      how about moving that drugget\\n\\n      well sir it was a bit rumpled certainly when i came back\\n      you see she fell on it and it lies on a polished floor with\\n      nothing to keep it in place i straightened it out afterwards\\n\\n      its a lesson to you that you cant deceive me constable\\n      macpherson said lestrade with dignity no doubt you thought\\n      that your breach of duty could never be discovered and yet a\\n      mere glance at that drugget was enough to convince me that\\n      someone had been admitted to the room its lucky for you my\\n      man that nothing is missing or you would find yourself in queer\\n      street im sorry to have called you down over such a petty\\n      business mr holmes but i thought the point of the second stain\\n      not corresponding with the first would interest you\\n\\n      certainly it was most interesting has this woman only been\\n      here once constable\\n\\n      yes sir only once\\n\\n      who was she\\n\\n      dont know the name sir was answering an advertisement about\\n      typewriting and came to the wrong numbervery pleasant genteel\\n      young woman sir\\n\\n      tall handsome\\n\\n      yes sir she was a wellgrown young woman i suppose you might\\n      say she was handsome perhaps some would say she was very\\n      handsome oh officer do let me have a peep says she she had\\n      pretty coaxing ways as you might say and i thought there was\\n      no harm in letting her just put her head through the door\\n\\n      how was she dressed\\n\\n      quiet sira long mantle down to her feet\\n\\n      what time was it\\n\\n      it was just growing dusk at the time they were lighting the\\n      lamps as i came back with the brandy\\n\\n      very good said holmes come watson i think that we have\\n      more important work elsewhere\\n\\n      as we left the house lestrade remained in the front room while\\n      the repentant constable opened the door to let us out holmes\\n      turned on the step and held up something in his hand the\\n      constable stared intently\\n\\n      good lord sir he cried with amazement on his face holmes\\n      put his finger on his lips replaced his hand in his breast\\n      pocket and burst out laughing as we turned down the street\\n      excellent said he come friend watson the curtain rings up\\n      for the last act you will be relieved to hear that there will be\\n      no war that the right honourable trelawney hope will suffer no\\n      setback in his brilliant career that the indiscreet sovereign\\n      will receive no punishment for his indiscretion that the prime\\n      minister will have no european complication to deal with and\\n      that with a little tact and management upon our part nobody will\\n      be a penny the worse for what might have been a very ugly\\n      incident\\n\\n      my mind filled with admiration for this extraordinary man\\n\\n      you have solved it i cried\\n\\n      hardly that watson there are some points which are as dark as\\n      ever but we have so much that it will be our own fault if we\\n      cannot get the rest we will go straight to whitehall terrace and\\n      bring the matter to a head\\n\\n      when we arrived at the residence of the european secretary it was\\n      for lady hilda trelawney hope that sherlock holmes inquired we\\n      were shown into the morningroom\\n\\n      mr holmes said the lady and her face was pink with her\\n      indignation this is surely most unfair and ungenerous upon your\\n      part i desired as i have explained to keep my visit to you a\\n      secret lest my husband should think that i was intruding into\\n      his affairs and yet you compromise me by coming here and so\\n      showing that there are business relations between us\\n\\n      unfortunately madam i had no possible alternative i have been\\n      commissioned to recover this immensely important paper i must\\n      therefore ask you madam to be kind enough to place it in my\\n      hands\\n\\n      the lady sprang to her feet with the colour all dashed in an\\n      instant from her beautiful face her eyes glazedshe totteredi\\n      thought that she would faint then with a grand effort she\\n      rallied from the shock and a supreme astonishment and\\n      indignation chased every other expression from her features\\n\\n      youyou insult me mr holmes\\n\\n      come come madam it is useless give up the letter\\n\\n      she darted to the bell\\n\\n      the butler shall show you out\\n\\n      do not ring lady hilda if you do then all my earnest efforts\\n      to avoid a scandal will be frustrated give up the letter and all\\n      will be set right if you will work with me i can arrange\\n      everything if you work against me i must expose you\\n\\n      she stood grandly defiant a queenly figure her eyes fixed upon\\n      his as if she would read his very soul her hand was on the bell\\n      but she had forborne to ring it\\n\\n      you are trying to frighten me it is not a very manly thing mr\\n      holmes to come here and browbeat a woman you say that you know\\n      something what is it that you know\\n\\n      pray sit down madam you will hurt yourself there if you fall\\n      i will not speak until you sit down thank you\\n\\n      i give you five minutes mr holmes\\n\\n      one is enough lady hilda i know of your visit to eduardo\\n      lucas of your giving him this document of your ingenious return\\n      to the room last night and of the manner in which you took the\\n      letter from the hidingplace under the carpet\\n\\n      she stared at him with an ashen face and gulped twice before she\\n      could speak\\n\\n      you are mad mr holmesyou are mad she cried at last\\n\\n      he drew a small piece of cardboard from his pocket it was the\\n      face of a woman cut out of a portrait\\n\\n      i have carried this because i thought it might be useful said\\n      he the policeman has recognized it\\n\\n      she gave a gasp and her head dropped back in the chair\\n\\n      come lady hilda you have the letter the matter may still be\\n      adjusted i have no desire to bring trouble to you my duty ends\\n      when i have returned the lost letter to your husband take my\\n      advice and be frank with me it is your only chance\\n\\n      her courage was admirable even now she would not own defeat\\n\\n      i tell you again mr holmes that you are under some absurd\\n      illusion\\n\\n      holmes rose from his chair\\n\\n      i am sorry for you lady hilda i have done my best for you i\\n      can see that it is all in vain\\n\\n      he rang the bell the butler entered\\n\\n      is mr trelawney hope at home\\n\\n      he will be home sir at a quarter to one\\n\\n      holmes glanced at his watch\\n\\n      still a quarter of an hour said he very good i shall wait\\n\\n      the butler had hardly closed the door behind him when lady hilda\\n      was down on her knees at holmess feet her hands outstretched\\n      her beautiful face upturned and wet with her tears\\n\\n      oh spare me mr holmes spare me she pleaded in a frenzy of\\n      supplication for heavens sake dont tell him i love him so\\n      i would not bring one shadow on his life and this i know would\\n      break his noble heart\\n\\n      holmes raised the lady i am thankful madam that you have come\\n      to your senses even at this last moment there is not an instant\\n      to lose where is the letter\\n\\n      she darted across to a writingdesk unlocked it and drew out a\\n      long blue envelope\\n\\n      here it is mr holmes would to heaven i had never seen it\\n\\n      how can we return it holmes muttered quick quick we must\\n      think of some way where is the despatchbox\\n\\n      still in his bedroom\\n\\n      what a stroke of luck quick madam bring it here a moment\\n      later she had appeared with a red flat box in her hand\\n\\n      how did you open it before you have a duplicate key yes of\\n      course you have open it\\n\\n      from out of her bosom lady hilda had drawn a small key the box\\n      flew open it was stuffed with papers holmes thrust the blue\\n      envelope deep down into the heart of them between the leaves of\\n      some other document the box was shut locked and returned to\\n      the bedroom\\n\\n      now we are ready for him said holmes we have still ten\\n      minutes i am going far to screen you lady hilda in return you\\n      will spend the time in telling me frankly the real meaning of\\n      this extraordinary affair\\n\\n      mr holmes i will tell you everything cried the lady oh\\n      mr holmes i would cut off my right hand before i gave him a\\n      moment of sorrow there is no woman in all london who loves her\\n      husband as i do and yet if he knew how i have actedhow i have\\n      been compelled to acthe would never forgive me for his own\\n      honour stands so high that he could not forget or pardon a lapse\\n      in another help me mr holmes my happiness his happiness our\\n      very lives are at stake\\n\\n      quick madam the time grows short\\n\\n      it was a letter of mine mr holmes an indiscreet letter\\n      written before my marriagea foolish letter a letter of an\\n      impulsive loving girl i meant no harm and yet he would have\\n      thought it criminal had he read that letter his confidence would\\n      have been forever destroyed it is years since i wrote it i had\\n      thought that the whole matter was forgotten then at last i heard\\n      from this man lucas that it had passed into his hands and that\\n      he would lay it before my husband i implored his mercy he said\\n      that he would return my letter if i would bring him a certain\\n      document which he described in my husbands despatchbox he had\\n      some spy in the office who had told him of its existence he\\n      assured me that no harm could come to my husband put yourself in\\n      my position mr holmes what was i to do\\n\\n      take your husband into your confidence\\n\\n      i could not mr holmes i could not on the one side seemed\\n      certain ruin on the other terrible as it seemed to take my\\n      husbands paper still in a matter of politics i could not\\n      understand the consequences while in a matter of love and trust\\n      they were only too clear to me i did it mr holmes i took an\\n      impression of his key this man lucas furnished a duplicate i\\n      opened his despatchbox took the paper and conveyed it to\\n      godolphin street\\n\\n      what happened there madam\\n\\n      i tapped at the door as agreed lucas opened it i followed him\\n      into his room leaving the hall door ajar behind me for i feared\\n      to be alone with the man i remember that there was a woman\\n      outside as i entered our business was soon done he had my\\n      letter on his desk i handed him the document he gave me the\\n      letter at this instant there was a sound at the door there were\\n      steps in the passage lucas quickly turned back the drugget\\n      thrust the document into some hidingplace there and covered it\\n      over\\n\\n      what happened after that is like some fearful dream i have a\\n      vision of a dark frantic face of a womans voice which\\n      screamed in french my waiting is not in vain at last at last\\n      i have found you with her there was a savage struggle i saw\\n      him with a chair in his hand a knife gleamed in hers i rushed\\n      from the horrible scene ran from the house and only next\\n      morning in the paper did i learn the dreadful result that night\\n      i was happy for i had my letter and i had not seen yet what the\\n      future would bring\\n\\n      it was the next morning that i realized that i had only\\n      exchanged one trouble for another my husbands anguish at the\\n      loss of his paper went to my heart i could hardly prevent myself\\n      from there and then kneeling down at his feet and telling him\\n      what i had done but that again would mean a confession of the\\n      past i came to you that morning in order to understand the full\\n      enormity of my offence from the instant that i grasped it my\\n      whole mind was turned to the one thought of getting back my\\n      husbands paper it must still be where lucas had placed it for\\n      it was concealed before this dreadful woman entered the room if\\n      it had not been for her coming i should not have known where his\\n      hidingplace was how was i to get into the room for two days i\\n      watched the place but the door was never left open last night i\\n      made a last attempt what i did and how i succeeded you have\\n      already learned i brought the paper back with me and thought of\\n      destroying it since i could see no way of returning it without\\n      confessing my guilt to my husband heavens i hear his step upon\\n      the stair\\n\\n      the european secretary burst excitedly into the room any news\\n      mr holmes any news he cried\\n\\n      i have some hopes\\n\\n      ah thank heaven his face became radiant the prime minister\\n      is lunching with me may he share your hopes he has nerves of\\n      steel and yet i know that he has hardly slept since this\\n      terrible event jacobs will you ask the prime minister to come\\n      up as to you dear i fear that this is a matter of politics we\\n      will join you in a few minutes in the diningroom\\n\\n      the prime ministers manner was subdued but i could see by the\\n      gleam of his eyes and the twitchings of his bony hands that he\\n      shared the excitement of his young colleague\\n\\n      i understand that you have something to report mr holmes\\n\\n      purely negative as yet my friend answered i have inquired at\\n      every point where it might be and i am sure that there is no\\n      danger to be apprehended\\n\\n      but that is not enough mr holmes we cannot live forever on\\n      such a volcano we must have something definite\\n\\n      i am in hopes of getting it that is why i am here the more i\\n      think of the matter the more convinced i am that the letter has\\n      never left this house\\n\\n      mr holmes\\n\\n      if it had it would certainly have been public by now\\n\\n      but why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house\\n\\n      i am not convinced that anyone did take it\\n\\n      then how could it leave the despatchbox\\n\\n      i am not convinced that it ever did leave the despatchbox\\n\\n      mr holmes this joking is very illtimed you have my assurance\\n      that it left the box\\n\\n      have you examined the box since tuesday morning\\n\\n      no it was not necessary\\n\\n      you may conceivably have overlooked it\\n\\n      impossible i say\\n\\n      but i am not convinced of it i have known such things to\\n      happen i presume there are other papers there well it may have\\n      got mixed with them\\n\\n      it was on the top\\n\\n      someone may have shaken the box and displaced it\\n\\n      no no i had everything out\\n\\n      surely it is easily decided hope said the premier let us\\n      have the despatchbox brought in\\n\\n      the secretary rang the bell\\n\\n      jacobs bring down my despatchbox this is a farcical waste of\\n      time but still if nothing else will satisfy you it shall be\\n      done thank you jacobs put it here i have always had the key\\n      on my watchchain here are the papers you see letter from lord\\n      merrow report from sir charles hardy memorandum from belgrade\\n      note on the russogerman grain taxes letter from madrid note\\n      from lord flowersgood heavens what is this lord bellinger\\n      lord bellinger\\n\\n      the premier snatched the blue envelope from his hand\\n\\n      yes it is itand the letter is intact hope i congratulate\\n      you\\n\\n      thank you thank you what a weight from my heart but this is\\n      inconceivableimpossible mr holmes you are a wizard a\\n      sorcerer how did you know it was there\\n\\n      because i knew it was nowhere else\\n\\n      i cannot believe my eyes he ran wildly to the door where is\\n      my wife i must tell her that all is well hilda hilda we\\n      heard his voice on the stairs\\n\\n      the premier looked at holmes with twinkling eyes\\n\\n      come sir said he there is more in this than meets the eye\\n      how came the letter back in the box\\n\\n      holmes turned away smiling from the keen scrutiny of those\\n      wonderful eyes\\n\\n      we also have our diplomatic secrets said he and picking up\\n      his hat he turned to the
